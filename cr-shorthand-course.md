This course will (hopefully) work with any shorthand system, and any book. Options are given to accommodate different types of systems and quality of books. It is an update of Cricket's Shorthand Tips.

Graduates of this course are encouraged to start [Swem's Systematic Course for Advanced  Writers](swem-systematic-speed-course.md).

# Introduction

Most modern shorthand students do not have the luxury of a teacher, or even a good self-instruction book (especially those of us who prefer older systems).

A good book will introduce the material in an order that allows for the most natural language as early as possible, have plenty of well-written shorthand to read and copy at all stages, give speed suggestions, and clearly state when enough rules have been taught that it is safe for you to write your own material.

This course will help you overcome those deficiencies in your book, and to do for yourself most of the things a good teacher would do.

# References

Most of this advice comes from books I read over the years without noting the source.

I did, however, remember to note the two I read most recently. Both these are available on [stenophile.com](www.stenophile.com) :

# Begin by Reading

Your goal at this stage is to become familiar with the rules and the building blocks in a variety of settings.  (Leslie)

You will learn faster by reading without pausing to write. Read each exercise a few times, following with your finger.

You will not yet be able to write accurately since you do not know which details are important or unimportant, especially when letters are modified by their neighbours. You will learn this by reading that shows the building blocks in a variety of settings, not by copying the same few words over and over.

Do not worry about the fine details of the rules. You will absorb them by reading. Leslie goes so far as to say that if teachers are asked about the details and reasons, they should ask the student to wait for an answer until the end of the course. Leslie's students had the luxury of plenty of reading material demonstrating each new rule.

## Diary

Keep a diary showing the date, exercise number, length in words, activity (Read, Copy, Dictation), the wpm (words per minute) and accuracy of each attempt. The numbers will go up and down, but the average will gradually go up. Include a section for other notes.

You do not need to count or time all the readings or copies, but do enough that you get a feel for speed vs accuracy and the effect of different types of repetition. This will change rapidly at first, then settle down, then change again as you increase your target speeds.

This is for your own use. Be as specific or vague as you like.

## New Vocabulary in the Text

For each new word:

* Spell it. (Refer to the chart you made of Letters by Group.)  
* Say it.

If you still cannot read it, then continue reading until the end of the sentence, or even the entire exercise, then come back to see if it makes more sense. If the extra context does not help, then use the key. There is no benefit at this stage to puzzling out the word.

(If you cannot decipher most of the words, then go directly to the key, but then reread it slowly. Spell and say each word, watching how the letters join into words. You should get past this stage within a few sentences.)

Reread each exercise until you can read it without referring to the key.

As you gain experience, look for letters that often occur together, and think of them as a single letter. Eg TR and SH. Do this for all words as needed. Eventually, only do it for words you struggle with or that demonstrate a new rule.

This process will help lock in the shapes of each letter and combination, and the outline of the entire word. Doing it out loud involves senses in your throat, mouth and ears, which enhances learning. Leslie does not recommend tracing outlines at any stage, but you may find it helps you focus and discover finer details.

Stay at this stage until you are 90% comfortable reading new material, or until you run out of new material, whichever comes first.

# Copying Shorthand

Your goal at this stage is to make your hand comfortable with the building blocks in a variety of settings, not to build speed. That will come later. (Leslie)

Modern books have a decent amount of shorthand examples in each chapter. You can start copying immediately, although I recommend waiting until the core theory is covered, or maybe more. Most writing mistakes by new students are automatically corrected by reading just a bit more.

Start by reading the exercise until you can do so comfortably. Now is the time to start puzzling out difficult words.

Your hand will be unstable at first.  (Leslie)

Vary the speed. Slow helps precision. Speed helps fluency and reduces hesitation. You need both. Write each exercise a few times at different speeds and see what happens.

Our brains and bodies remember the first and final repeats more than the middle ones. They should be as fast as possible without losing readability.

## Column Method for Difficult Words {#column-method-for-difficult-words}

This method works well if you suspect a penmanship issue, or are not sure which of several sounds or abbreviations are intended.

Make one column for each letter. The first row is the letter in shorthand. Following rows are your best guess at what it might be, roughly ordered by probability, written in plain text.

After that, work through all the combinations by brute force.

You will have to adapt it a bit if combinations of letters create word parts.

This method is also good for checking if a proposed abbreviation has other possible interpretations.

## A Note on Repetition

As you repeat a section at the same speed, your writing will improve, then plateau, then degrade. Stop when it plateaus, usually within 5 repetitions. 

“Anything that is dull and uninteresting is of doubtful pedagogic value. Also, excessive repetition generally results in progressive deterioration of the outlines practiced.” - Gregg Shorthand Functional Method Teachers Handbook (1936), from [stenophile.com](www.stenophile.com) .

## A Note on Reading Ahead and Writing Your Own Material

Be very careful writing your own material until you finish the book.

Modern books for most systems have enough practice material in each chapter that you won’t need any new material until the core theory is covered. Some systems have theory in one book and practice material keyed to the text in another.

Orthographic systems such as Orthic and Teeline quickly teach an acceptable way to write all words – just use the alphabet. You can start writing after learning the alphabet and combinations. I recommend you wait a bit, since the next few pages usually teach simple but powerful ways to reduce writing. You do not want your hand to get stuck on the Fully Written versions.

Older phonetic books are a challenge. Work through the core theory and available samples BEFORE writing new material. Often an outline that seems correct now does not follow later rules – to the point that you wrote the opposite of what you intended. Then be very careful to proof-read all your writing and make sure you follow all the rules. Making your own reference book will be very useful for these shorthands.

Beware of creating your own abbreviations, or even simplifying spelling, before learning the entire system. Forkner and Gregg both say to leave out vowels, so Can \-\> CN, right? Several chapters later, they say that Can \-\> C, and CN means cannot. All your old notes are wrong. For the next year, every time you try to write Can your hand will write Cannot, and every time you read CN you will wonder if you wrote Cannot correctly or Can incorrectly.

If you aren’t sure where the core theory stops and optional theory begins, read more of the book, not to learn, but to see which sections are core theory, which are optional but useful, and which can wait. Some books separate those nicely. Some mix them together.

Quickly reading the entire book will also give you advance warning of additional sizes, positions, and shapes that you might confuse with the earlier shapes if not aware. For now, read to see what exists, not to learn.

## Find the Size Your Hand Prefers

Writing too small will slow your writing, since you need to be more precise. Too large will be awkward for your hand. Aim for a comfortable, flowing size. There are a few Gregg articles about size, with samples from expert writers. One fits 500 words per page, another fits only 100\.

To Start: Draw straight lines on paper, a full inch apart, and copy the previous paragraph, in cursive and/or print at whatever size your hand likes. Then measure the height of several letters. Typically lowercase letters are 2-3mm and uppercase letters are twice that. If your longhand is larger than average, then your shorthand will probably also be larger than average, and vice versa. Adjust a bit if needed to keep the lengths distinct.

Repeat this test with shorthand before and after every few writing sessions. Your hand will change when it's tired, and as it learns the shapes better. As you become more consistent you can reduce the frequency.

Consistency is more important than exact lengths. All tall letters should be the same height.

I only learned about this test a few years ago, and tried it after decades of writing Gregg. I discovered my hand was happier, accuracy better, and speed faster when my large letters were 8mm instead of 7.

Experiment with skipping lines. Even if the size doesn’t change, it sometimes gives your hand a bit more freedom. Again, repeat the experiment after some experience, and again later. Results may change as you get more familiar with the shapes, and as you build speed.

"The actual size of the characters may be varied according to circumstances, such as the goodness of the light and the writing materials. The minuteness of any kind of writing is limited by the size of the smallest characters. In Orthic the small size may be made as small as desired, and the small circle may be reduced to a dot, but it is best to make the small characters about one-twelfth of an inch long (2.1mm), and the large ones at least twice as big." -- Clarey, Orthic Revised, General Rules

## A Note On Perfection

Do not strive for perfect notes. That will slow you down. Besides, what is perfect?

If another person familiar with the style, who has read several other words on the same page, can read 95% of the words, then your writing is 95% accurate. You might add “uses the appropriate abbreviation for your chosen level,” but that is still a far cry from perfection.

Dictation that is slow enough to be 100% accurate helps you write accurately. It does not help you build speed.

Dictation that is so fast you can only reach 80% accuracy helps you build speed, shows you which words need practice, and helps you write easy words faster so you have more time for difficult words. Doing all your work at this speed risks penmanship degradation and loss of accuracy.

Therefore, work at a variety of speeds, and pay attention to what type of practice you need most at any given time. End each session by writing either perfectly (tracing well-written shorthand) or writing as fast as you can while remaining accurate.

## Typical Copying Session

The first quarter of each session, or one session in four, should be spent reviewing the theory and copying words that demonstrate each rule. You can stop this once you can accurately take dictation from unseen material at 100wpm on your first attempt. (Modern books organize their practice material to include a systematic review of the theory so you can skip this step. Luxury!)

The final five minutes of each session should be spent on penmanship practice. For now, trace well-written shorthand with a dry pen. That will force you to notice subtle details. Later, once you are confident you know the details, alternate between this and writing neatly at a comfortable speed (not dictation, but not too slow either). Your hand will remember this copy more than any other.

If you have a sample to copy, start by reading it as before. Now is the time to start puzzling out difficult words. The practice is useful, and will be even more useful when you need to read your own less-than-perfect writing. Try the column method, but use the key rather than spend too long on a difficult word.

Your first few writing sessions will be horrible. Work only until you stop improving, then take a break. We can only improve so much each day, and extending it will not help.

Copy the first 10-20 words a few times. Watch how your writing smoothes out and speeds up, then plateaus, then degrades. Stop copying that section and move to the next just as it plateaus – usually after only a few repetitions. Use the same process on individual words if they give more than the usual amount of trouble. Using the building blocks in a variety of words will help more than repeating the same words. (Leslie says to copy each exercise only once, but his students have plenty of material to copy.)

Time your first and final copies of each exercise and keep a diary of word count, speed, and accuracy. Don’t worry about syllable count. “A word is a word” is close enough. Keep a diary of your final speed for each exercise.

After the first few sessions, extend the length of exercises to 50-100 words, occasionally as high as 200\. (Varying the length of exercise helps.)

It is tempting to build a dictionary of all new words. I found this was a waste of time. Currently, all words are new to you. After reading a few exercises, you will realize you’ve memorized some words, are familiar with others, and still have to build most from scratch. After a few more exercises, some that were only familiar will now be memorized, and some that you had to build from scratch will be familiar. Building blocks will follow the same progression. This is a natural process, and will happen with very little extra effort.

No matter how much practice you get, and how many words reach the stages of memorized and familiar, there will still be many thousands of words that you have to build from scratch. Practice using the building blocks in a variety of words, instead of memorizing vocabulary or building a dictionary.

That is not to say word lists are never useful.

* A well-chosen list can be a good summary of the rules, or help you lock in a rule.  
* A list of abbreviations helps you remember to use them during dictation.  
* A list of names at the beginning of a meeting makes it easy to make temporary abbreviations.  
* A list of technical terms that sound similar but have different meanings helps you learn the words and find ways to distinguish them.  
* A list in the back of your notebook can help you remember uncommon or difficult words, especially if you need them months later.

Once you finish the core theory, choose an exercise about 20 words long. Write it, then proof-read it carefully. Your sample needs to follow the rules, but the penmanship only has to be readable, not perfect. Re-read the core theory (or your summary of it) often, so you use all of it for your samples.

Modern books have enough accurately written samples that you know the theory is correct. Luxury!

## Four Column Method for Copying

This method works well while you are at the copying stage, and later for penmanship practice. It also helps you build hand speed separate from brain speed.

Make four columns by dividing two pages into two columns each, so you can see all at the same time. Copy the exercise from the book into the first column. If you are creating your own material, write your first attempt in the first column. Do not go to the margin; you will need space for corrections.

Check your work and make corrections. Choose a few words you struggled with, copy them a few times, then copy the exercise again. Aim for a slightly uncomfortable speed, at which your notes are readable and follow the rules, but are not perfect.

Then copy from the first column to the second, check your work, make corrections, and practice difficult sections. Then copy from the second column to the third, and the third to the forth. Check your work, make corrections, and practice difficult sections after each copy.

The 1st column needs to be accurate, since it will be the model for the others. Accurate means readable and following the rules, not perfect penmanship. Go as slow as needed to reach this level.

Speed up a bit for the 2nd column. Your writing will be much smoother.

Speed up even more for the 3rd column. Go so fast that your writing is only 95% accurate.

The 4th and final column should be slow enough for 98% accurate note, but no slower. Your hand will remember this copy most. Too slow will teach slow writing. Too fast will teach inaccurate writing.

It will take a bit of practice to learn how fast to write each column. The speeds will increase over time. Some passages will be easier or harder than others. Find speeds that usually work and don't worry about it.

Some people do this in rows, leaving four rows between each original copy, instead of in four columns.

Leslie recommends that students take dictation with the shorthand image in front of them. Having the key in front is especially useful when they are new to dictation and trying to apply several new skills at the same time. All students – fast, slow or lazy – will reduce their reliance on the text as their confidence and speed increase.

# Working With Word Lists -- Spaced Repetition

As stated earlier, a list of all the words you encounter is a waste of time, but lists can be useful for other reasons.

The best way to learn lists is spaced repetition. Each time you successfully remember a word, promote it to a longer review frequency. If you struggle with a word you previously mastered, demote it. 

Some people use a deck of cards, one card per word, longhand on one side and shorthand on the other. Leitner Box is a famous system for managing repetition using cards. Apps such as Anki have virtual cards and keep track of which words should be repeated and how often. I find the physical cards use too much paper and are hard to carry. It also takes too long to scan and enter each word for a computer version. (I used a program similar to Anki to study music vocabulary, which was text-only and easy to enter. I got 100% on that section of the exam.)

For shorthand, I prefer the accordion column method. Write the longhand in one column and shorthand in the column beside it. Fold or cover the paper so you can only see the longhand. Write the shorthand in the next column, uncover the key, and note the mistakes. Adjust it so you can only see the shorthand. Write the longhand in the next column and note the mistakes. (You can save time and paper by saying the longhand but not writing it.) Now repeat the process with only the words you didn’t get first try. Repeat again, until you have gotten each word correct more often than you got it wrong.

Copy the words you did not get correct the first time to a page with tomorrow’s date. You will work on them again then. Copy the words you got correct the first time to another column (or page), marked with the date you want to review them. Words you always get correct the first time need to be reviewed less often.

# Personal Reference Binder

Make a small binder of reference material, and add to it as you learn. Make sections for:

* Theory, sorted by lesson  
* Theory, sorted by alphabet (Include cross-reference entries between normal and shorthand spelling, so you can use it for reading or writing.)  
* Vocabulary (Only include abbreviations, words that demonstrate a new rule, and words you expect to struggle with.)

Update this book at the end of each homework session – after your hand is comfortable with the new shapes. Sort the contents of each page in any order that makes sense to you. The order does not have to be perfect.

When a page is filled, rewrite it spread over two or more pages, to make room for more. You will find that you need shorter explanations and fewer examples for familiar rules each time.

Making the binder will help you learn the rules, and will also give you a quick way to look them up. 

# Taking Dictation

Dictation is learned in stages:
- First few dictations. Everything is new to you.
- Dictation with full preparation. Copy the exercise before taking dictation.
- Dictation with reduced preparation. Read the text and practice new or problem words before taking dictation.
- Dictation with no preparation.

I have given guidelines for when to move to each stage, but they're mostly guesses. The only systems that have speed suggestions also have exercises keyed to each chapter, so students have only a few new rules in each exercises.

As you enter each stage, alternate a bit between methods.

## Relax

Tension and aiming for perfection are the biggest causes of slow writing. Relax! (Yeah, saying Relax doesn’t work for me, either.)

Treat each attempt as an experiment, not a test. How many words can you write at least a letter for? How many words can you write more completely? What happens when you change speed or preparation?

If that doesn’t work, then slow down for a bit.

This course will vary the speed. Sometimes you will write slowly (and more accurately). Sometimes you will write faster (and less accurately, sometimes even 20% inaccurate). Sometimes you will read or write new material. Sometimes you will read or write familiar material. Each type of exercise works on different skills, and all are important.

## Duration vs Speed

Start with 1-minute dictations. Longer dictations will be slower – about 10wpm for each minute added. Increasing your maximum speed will automatically increase duration at lower speeds. Simply extending duration at lower speeds is less effective.

Stay with 1-minute until your first take is 90% readable at 60-80wpm and your final take at that speed is 95% readable. Then increase the duration by 1 minute, starting 10wpm slower. Increase by 1 minute each time you reach 60-80wpm, until you reach 5 minutes. How many words for a 1-minute dictation? That depends on your current speed. Round up to a complete sentence, within reason.

Another way to increase duration is to combine short exercises, where you know you can reach the target speed, into longer exercises. One book suggests dividing a 4-minute exercise into 4 x 1-minute exercises, then combining them into 2 x 2-minute exercises, then finally into 1 x 4-minute exercise, with a 10wpm drop at each stage.

Leslie states that increasing speed for short dictations will automatically increase duration at lower speeds.

If the voice stops before you finish writing, make a mark to show where you are, and keep writing. The remainder is good practice even though you don’t count it. (This is also a way to accommodate multiple students with the same dictation. Fast students will finish with the dictation. Slower students will finish later, for a slower actual speed with the same dictation.) Writing for a few words after dictation stops doesn't affect your mark. If you write more than that, and want to compare your speed to other students, divide the words actually written by the intended length of dictation.

## Text Reader Programs

Most text reader programs (aka test to speech) are too fast for early dictation, or are not properly calibrated. These are pretty good:

``` see how the line ends work ```

* [http://qwertysteno.com/Dictation/](http://qwertysteno.com/Dictation/)  
It doesn’t sound as nice as a human dictator, but it’s a lot more patient.  
* [https://www.naturalreaders.com/online/](https://www.naturalreaders.com/online/)  
This one is reported to sound better, and may do other languages.

Most textbooks use 10wpm steps. They mark words in 20-word groups, and teachers use charts for the number of seconds per group at each speed. Your computer does not need you to mark word groups, and can dictate at any speed.

Previous generations succeeded with 10wpm steps through 80 or even 100wpm. I would use that size step both for increasing target speeds and repeating an exercise, until you reach at least 80wpm. Larger steps are more likely to break you out of ruts, and to highlight problem sections. Smaller will give you more successes and confidence.

If you cannot reach the target speed, try dividing the exercise into sections as described above instead of reducing step size. Prove to yourself that your pen can move fast enough.

However, sometimes a smaller step makes more sense, especially at the higher speeds. Experiment. If the larger step doesn’t work, try a smaller step, or try an even larger step.

 There is no benefit to repeated failure.

## Practicing Problem Areas

Watch your accuracy as you practice. At first it will get better, then plateau, then degrade. Stop when it plateaus. More practice after this point will do more harm than good. Usually that is five or fewer repetitions.

Observe where you begin to fall behind in dictation. The problem outline is probably a few words before that. The problem is in preparing to write the outline, not in the execution. Questionnaire and motion pictures studies by Klein (described later) show even expert writers do not know which outlines they write faster or slower.

Try including a few words on either side of the problem. This will prevent hesitation as you approach a word that worries you.

Vary the speed. Slow helps precision. Speed helps fluency and reduces hesitation. You need both. If you made your own outline, consider changing it.

Our brains and bodies remember the first and final repeats more than the middle ones. They should be as fast as possible without losing readability.

“Anything that is dull and uninteresting is of doubtful pedagogic value. Also, excessive repetition generally results in progressive deterioration of the outlines practiced.” --  Gregg Shorthand Functional Method Teachers Handbook (1936). [stenophile.com](www.stenophile.com)

## Ruts and Plateaus

A rut is when the brain or body gets used to going a certain speed. Increasing speed beyond your capability and then slowing down will quickly break a rut. A plateau is when the brain or body simply cannot go faster until several new neural connections form. Trust that those connections are forming even if you see no difference. Keep the pressure on for speed, but also include a variety of speed, accuracy, and duration so those connections form properly. Eventually the last nerve will connect and your speed will increase suddenly.

 (Dr. Kenneth H Cooper, The New Aerobics, 1978, compares building muscle nerves and blood vessels to building new roads. The entire network must be finished before any of it can be used.) 

Be prepared to stall every time you increase the speed. Some increases will be worse than others. Leslie recommends pushing all exercises to 20% error rate. Swem recommends even faster. “Push the speed up to twice as fast as you can actually write it, and make an heroic effort to get something down for every word. It will not be good shorthand that you write, but it will serve to jar your hand out of its habit of sluggishness.” He warns not to attempt this before 140wpm, no more than once a month, and to “always end a session of this sort with a goodly amount of precision practice to offset the shattering tendencies of forced speed.”

Push each exercise as far as it will go, but do not waste time pushing it farther. Some are harder than others. (If more than one exercise in five is hard, you are going too fast.) It is better to practice all the building blocks in a variety of combinations than to perfect a few.

In the same vein, some are easier than others. Use these to practice going even faster.

The total repetitions for easy and hard exercises will be about the same. The only difference is your final speed and accuracy. (That may change when you graduate from this course and move to Swem’s.)

# First Few Dictations

Your goal at this stage is to become comfortable taking dictation and for your hand to start to stabilize with the new shapes. That’s it. No speed. Have a good copy of the shorthand in front of you.

Start with a 1-minute exercise fully prepared in the previous stage. Attempt dictation at 20wpm. It will probably be horrible. Try it again at 20wpm, and maybe a third time. Read your work carefully, make corrections, and practice problem areas after each attempt.

By now your writing will be more stable, and you will know which areas are more difficult. Increase the speed by 10wpm and try again. Stay at this speed until your writing stabilizes, and increase it again.

Repeat for 5-6 attempts at each exercise, then move to the next exercise, regardless of speed reached. You need a bit of repetition, then variety.

If you reach 95% accuracy on your first attempt, increase the starting speed by 10wpm.

Stay at this stage until your first attempt is about as good as your second, then move to the next stage.

# Dictation with Full Preparation

Your goal at this stage is to increase the number of words and building blocks you are familiar with, in a variety of settings. A bit of speed pressure helps lock these in, and helps you cover more material faster, but variety and accuracy are more important than speed.

Use a fully prepared exercise as before. You may need to create more. Your writing will be fairly shaky at first. It will smooth out as you read and write more. The goal is readable, not perfect. Keep the good copy in front of you during dictation, and look at it when needed.

Start each exercise at the same speed as before, but this time increase by 10wpm with each repetition. Check carefully and practice problem areas before the next speed. Repeat this speed once if accuracy is below 95%. You do not need to repeat any other speed, just keep pushing. When you reach a speed with only 90% accuracy, practice the problem areas and go down two steps. This speed will now feel slow! Finish by practicing the problem areas, if any remain at the final speed, and move to the next exercise.

These numbers may not work out perfectly for your first few dictations. Play with the speeds for 5 repetitions, then go slow enough for 95% accuracy on your final attempt.

This sequence should take 5-6 repetitions for most exercises. Remember that some exercises are harder or easier. Push the easy ones faster to get used to the higher speed, and don’t worry about the harder ones – unless you start saying more than one in five is hard! (In that case, slow down for a bit.)

When your first attempt is 95% accurate most of the time, or your final speed (the one you slow down for) is 30wpm faster than starting speed, increase your starting speed. Remember to keep a diary.

Your first dictation should be 90-95% accurate immediately after a speed increase. You may need a second attempt at the same speed for a few exercises after a speed increase. Use your own judgement, but in general keep pushing.

If you are stuck at a speed for more than 10 exercises, try increasing it anyways for a few exercises, then dropping back if necessary. Sometimes the extra pressure helps break us out of a rut. Try again after another five exercises at the slower speed.

Sometimes try a slower starting speed and aim for practically perfect. (Aim for it, but don’t worry if you don’t achieve it.)

Sometimes try a longer exercise. Expect a 10wpm drop for each additional minute of dictation – even more until you get used to the new length.

Remember that perfection is defined by your ability to read it in a few months, not whether it belongs in a textbook.

Move to the next stage after five successes with a first dictation at 40-60wpm. (I’m guessing here. The books aren’t clear.)

# Dictation with Reduced Preparation

Your goal at this stage is to write familiar words rapidly, and continue to use the building blocks in new settings. By now you're probably writing so fast there is no time to look at the good copy, so there's no sense keeping it in front of you.

Instead of writing the entire exercise from text, only prepare words you expect to struggle with. (Leslie recommends leaving this stage until much later but his students have the luxury of textbooks with plenty of prepared shorthand in each chapter.)

You will probably need to go down 10-20wpm as you enter this stage, and take longer to build to your top speed.

Again, 5-6 repetitions, starting with slow (90-95% accuracy) to learn the material. Check this work carefully. Then icrease by 10wpm until 90% accuracy. Reduce two steps for the final attempt, which should be 95% accuracy. Increase starting speed as before.

Move to the next stage after five successes (95% accuracy) with a first dictation at 40-60wpm. (Again, I’m guessing here.)

# Dictation with No Preparation, aka Cold Dictation

Your goal at this stage is to increase speed for familiar words, and to be able to rapidly build new words from the building blocks.

Be prepared for your starting speed to drop at first. Build it up as before.

Do your best to get down at least something for each word, and leave a gap for the correction. This will feel wrong at first, but an incomplete outline that hints at the word is better than writing a correct outline and missing the rest of the sentence. After the first dictation, choose an outline for the word and use that for the remaining dictations.

Some writers leave larger margins and use a mark instead of a gap to mark needed corrections.

In real world dictation, do the same thing. If you expect to need the word again, take the time to develop a good outline for it. Avoid the temptation to make abbreviations. Shorthand speed comes from using the building blocks well, not creating abbreviations. (See section on Klein’s motion picture studies.)

Having said that, it makes sense to create abbreviations for short-term use, especially for names or words with awkward outlines, or different words with similar outlines. When you have time, copy all abbreviations to the back of your notebook. Also mark if you have, or have not, confirmed the spelling. (I have learned the hard way that abbreviations that make sense at the time will be impossible to read as little as a month later, and if I don’t mark “spelling confirmed” I will question it.)

Start one exercise in ten slow enough to for 98% accuracy on the first attempt, then build speed as before. This “mailable transcript” speed will increase as your top speed increases. This is merely to watch how it changes, since practice with dictation at challenging speeds will help more than dictation at mailable speeds.

When you can take cold dictation at 60wpm and 95% accuracy for one minute, move to Swem’s Systematic Speed Course for Advanced Writers. (Swem says to wait until you reach 80-100wpm for five minutes.)

# Motion Picture Study by Klein

Leslie reports on a motion picture study by Klein. Experts took dictation at 220wpm for five minutes. “Good school learners” took dictation at 140wpm. They also answered a questionnaire.

Do not place too much faith in your observations of which outlines are faster or slower. Instead, pay attention to where you fall behind in dictation.

“Of the three experts, Dupraw and Rifkin were better able than Swem to tell with what relative speeds they wrote the combinations. When the total number of instances and occurrences of all the combinations is used, it is seen that Dupraw was right in approximately half the instances; Rifkin, in seven-tenths of the instances; and Swem in but one-fifth of the instances.”

All writers’ pens moved at approximately the same speed while writing. The difference in overall speed was in the time spent not writing. The learners’ pen speed was 333-440wpm, with as little as 31-42% of the time spent actually writing. The experts’ pen speed was 417-447, with 47-53% of the time spent writing.)

“The students paused about five times as frequently as the experts in writing the combinations of this study.”

There was no consistency between number vs length of individual pauses between experts, only in the total time paused.

> In one 10-second section of the film, Swem, who as stated before, is constantly analyzing his writing processes, paused 11 times, whereas Dupraw, who seldom attempts to analyze his writing habits, paused but 3 times.
>
> Thus the one expert, taking dictation at 220 words a minute, 80 words a minute faster than the dictation of the learner, wrote with a pen speed of only 415 words a minute, compared with the pen speed of 451 words a minute of Learner No. 3, taking dictation at 140 words a minute."

# Swem’s Systematic Speed Course for Advanced Writers

Swem states:

> The goal toward which you are striving is to reach the point where you can take new matter at your top speed and write it as well as you would after taking it two or three times. Of course, no matter how much skill you may eventually acquire you will occasionally "flunk" an outline or a phrase. In reading it back you will correct it, but the fact that you wrote it incorrectly the first time should be no cause for worry. It is done by everybody. Your aim should be simply to bring these errors down to a minimum.

The first fifteen minutes of the regular session is reviewing theory. The last five is penmanship.

Each exercise begins with a very fast dictation (so fast you can’t quite keep up), slows it to "practically perfect," then builds it up to the original speed, maybe a bit faster, with increased neatness and accuracy. 

I did not recommend this for the earlier stages because a very fast first dictation too early is a waste of time. You will spend as much time correcting mistakes in your first attempt as you would have spent by writing slower in the first place.

Swem uses the same one hour practice each day for five days, then adds two sessions with a variety of work for a total of seven hours a week. The practice changes when you reach 125wpm and again at 150wpm.

Swem's course is for students who are at 80-100wpm for five minutes. Here are some adjustments if you start it sooner.

* Keep a diary as before. Watch for changes, ruts and plateaus.  
* Start with 1-minute dictations, and increase duration as suggested earlier.  
* You will do more than one exercise per hour than Swem suggests, because your exercises are 1 minute, not 5.  
* Your first several exercises with this system should be less stressful than Swem suggests. Build some successes. Then go for it!

Do something a bit different once every five exercises, until you reach the speed Swem recommends for starting the course.

* Start an exercise at the fastest you can make a “mailable transcript” on your first attempt.  
* Try not slowing down as much for your practically perfect repetition.  
* Start an exercise a bit faster than your maximum speed.  
* Push an exercise two steps faster than your maximum speed, then slow down again for the final copy.  
* Write a longer exercise (at a slower speed) even if you haven’t mastered shorter exercises.  
* Write an exercise from the previous week that you don't quite remember.

All these speeds will increase as you continue to increase the top speed at which you can record a speaker who will not slow down, and accepts a small loss of accuracy to keep up.
