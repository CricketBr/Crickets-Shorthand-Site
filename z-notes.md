# Notes To Self

## To Do Or Consider

- check all files have licence statement and links to orig files, not just link to a page that has them.

- change full page image structure -- keep orig in folder named orig, and put cropped full page in -bits.
    - rename split -> bits ??
    - clip page edges better for "all the word" page.

- how to write *today*

- We definitely need a reverse lookup for the abbreviations and abbreviating principles!! It can refer to this doc for details.

- try {#myID} instead of anchors

- go through man, sup for jeremy's notes

- Move source to front of paragraph

- ph to H

- fix css -- make it absolute path

- move Sources to sep file and include it? Or just link to it? Do I need to force people to download it if they save the page?

- ```### My Great Heading {#custom-id}```
