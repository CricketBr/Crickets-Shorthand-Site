## Introduction to Orthic Consolidated 

Orthic shorthand is a good first shorthand for most students. It is quick to learn at the Fully Written Level, and multiple levels can be used in a single sentence without confusion. Based on stroke counts, its speed potential is comparable to other office and personal use shorthands. The Abbreviated and Reporting levels are even faster.

In keeping with tradition, I'll begin with deficiencies of previous books: 
* The rules are spread out over too many publications.
* The rules in the different books are sometimes inconsistent.

Callendar wrote the Manual in 1891, then, instead of updating it, he published the Supplement in 1982. This booklet moved some rules from advanced to intermediate, and even changed a few. Stevens wrote The Teaching of Orthic Shorthand in 1896, and, again, instead of writing a complete book, he told the readers to refer to the previous two publications. He also moved rules between levels, added some, and, I suspect, changed a few. Finally, in 1911, Clarey wrote Orthic Shorthand: Revised, Extended and Improved. That book brought together all the rules, changed a few, and added many rules for prefixes and terminations.

This book addresses the first deficiency, hopefully without creating too much more confusion. It does so by consolidating all the rules from all the earlier books, except some that are only in the Reporting Style. It is *not* intended as an introduction to Orthic. The Manual or Revised is best for that. (I recommend the Manual, and anything Revised does differently just feels wrong to anyone who started with the Manual.) It assumes you have read the Manual or Revised. 

[Cricket's Shorthand Course](cr-shorthand-course.md) will help with the second deficiency.


Hopefully it creates more clarity than confusion.

It is organized into the following parts: 

### A Note About Styles, Levels, and Mixing Sources {#styles-levels}

All books agree that Fully Written comes first and Reporting comes last. The middle levels are a bit fuzzy. Ordinary seems to come first. Abbreviated, Supplement and Correspondence seem to be the same. Reporting is an experimental level which varies between sources. As rules were proven safe and useful, later books moved them to the intermediate levels. This page includs only a few Reporting rules, and they are clearly marked.

*A smaller rule set, with building blocks that you use without hesitation, is faster than a larger one with rules you have to think about.*

The Manual, Supplement, and Teaching use the same rules until Reporting Style, although they disagree about which level some rules apply to. In general, newer books move rules to earlier levels, as they are proven safe, useful, and easy to learn. I've highlighted the rare cases where the rules conflict.

Where the same rule is in multiple books, sometimes I only included the oldest, except where a later book is better stated or easier to clip.

Revised mostly uses the same rules in Fully Written, but not entirely. The differences are more significant at the higher levels, conflicting with the other books often enough that I recommend caution. Many rules that Revised says are intermediate are used so rarely that I'd consider them advanced.

*If not stated, the rule comes from The Manual.* I have been careful to show where each rule is introduced, but less careful to show who said what. Note that, since it's difficult not to pick up the original accent, you cannot rely on that to separate my words from any other author's.



### Discrepancies

Often a writer will explain a rule, then break it on the next page. I think that happens for a few reasons:
- They first learned Pitman, so spelling phonetically is automatic, even when they try to write orthographically (aka using standard English spelling).

- They are so used to writing advanced levels that they forget the less obvious differences between that and FW.

- It's often difficult to explain a rule, so they over-simplify without realizing it (then intend to follow the rule as written but forget).

- They are used to writing for experienced readers who can fill in the blanks easily, and don't need perfect penmanship.

Don't worry about it. The only true test of shorthand quality is whether the intended reader can read it at the intended time, for the intended purpose. (I strongly suggest you define those each time you pick up the pen.)

### Notation

Use the joining rules for Fully Written unless otherwise specified.

Letters in brackets are compound letters or slurs.

* ^ indicates the following letters are raised.
* . indicates a small gap to indicate omitted letters, as in Mode 2.
* _ indicates the following letters are lowered.
* \* indicates a dot on the line (or a tiny bit above). Always preceded and followed by a gap.
* : indicates a sharp join between vowels. Otherwise all vowels have rounded joins.
* I indicates dotted i. E is used if the dot is optional.
* Dot for doubled letters is not included.
* () indicates a compound letter.
* vowels are listed in order written.

Where there is more than one way to write a letter or compound, I added extra characeters. Often the number chosen reflects the shape of the compound, as a mnemonic, but this was not always possible. Eg **ing** : `(ing1)` = straight, `(ing2)` = curved, chosen because 1 is straight and 2 is curved. `(ph-b)` is the PH that looks like the letter b. (Cricket)

## General Rules for Fully Written Style


#### Two Sizes of Letters
Most books say use 1:3, but then use less in the Two Sizes image, and somewhere between 1:2 and 1:3 in actual writing. It's rarely a problem except for debates between students.

![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/1two-sizes-m005.png){: .man}\
Manual: alphabet, letters grouped by size, st, ste, en, ens, inst, nt, er, ers, abs, against, epitaph

![shorthand image](assets/teach-1-bits/1twosizes-t102.jpg){: .teach1}\
Teaching 1: Alphabet, CH, ing1, ing2

Note the U is at a different angle between Teaching and the Manual. It's not critical.

![shorthand image](assets/teach-1-bits/1groups-t102.jpg){: .teach1-1row}\
Teaching 1: Letters grouped in another way.


> "The actual *size* of the characters may be varied according to circumstances, such as the goodness of the light and the writing materials. The minuteness of any kind of writing is limited by the size of the smallest characters. In Orthic the small size may be made as small as desired, and the small circle may be reduced to a dot. But it is best to make the small characters about one-twelfth of an inch \[2.1mm\] long, and the large ones twice as big." (Revised, p3, General Rules)

#### Position on the Line, aka Mode
The rules for this are a mess.

Just do what looks right to you. If you read something that doesn't make sense, remember some writers will write higher or lower than you do.

**Details:** 

In the Manual, Callendar claims the first letter sits on the line, then on the same page (Two Sizes of Character) starts *epitaph* above the line, with P sitting on the line. In St John II, *it* and *in* start on the line and go upwards. T is a downstroke, so the rule isn't first downstroke. 

In Teaching 1, Stevens says nothing, but on the first page of the Preface to the New Testament <https://orthic.shorthand.fun/reading> *it* starts below the line and T sits on the line. In Teaching 2 he has more fun and uses starting position to indicate an entire omitted word.

In Revised, Clarey says, "The first letter of a word generally begins or ends on the line, but A, E and O may be raised when preceeding downstrokes." (Revised, General Rules, p3)

It looks like Stevens is the outlier, but since they wrote the majority of the reading material, we cannot just ignore them.

It all gets even more confusing when we add modes to indicate omitted letters. See [General Methods of Abbreviation](#general-methods-of-abbreviation-including-ordinary-style).

#### Doubling a Letter

Most letters are doubled by putting a dot underneath. EE, II, EI and IE are exceptions. The dot is omitted unless absolutely necessary to avoid confusion with a similar word in all but the Fully Written Style.

![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/1doubled-ltrs-m003.png){: .man}\
Manual: odd, too, ee, sleep, sup

![shorthand image](assets/teach-1-bits/1double-t103.jpg){: .teach1}\
Teaching 1: aa, Baal, foot

![shorthand image](assets/teach-1-bits/ei-t103.jpg){: .teach1}\
Teaching 1: ee, ei, reed, reid

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/1double-r02.jpg){: .teach1}\
Revised: odd, coo, ee, peep, pup

See also EE.

Where there are double a's or oo's, leave out one. (Teaching 1)

![shorthand image](assets/teach-1-bits/1double,a,o-t107.jpg){: .teach1}\
Teaching 1: command, son, soon


#### Connecting Tick

A short connecting tick maybe used after ER, TH, etc, and when they are followed by G, P and S. (Revised, p3, General Rules)

This rule is only in Revised. Clarey may need this more than the other writers due to his different style of writing. Sometimes it's because there isn't space between loops. Sometimes it's because he wants an R to remain round, not looped as in Gregg. (Cricket)

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/1connecting-tick-r03.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: er, th, G, P, S, dirg, faiths, serpent

#### Dividing Words

You can divide a word to keep it on the line. Beware that this might be confused with writing by mode. (Cricket)

![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/1divide-line-m005.png){: .man}\
Manual: lawsuit, Woolwich, virgin

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/1divide-r03.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: lawsuit, bagpipes



#### Punctuation

So they are not confused with raised A (and) and raised O (though).

Does this also apply to brackets, so they aren't confused with G and K? (Cricket)

Full stop may be indicated by a space (Revised) (Full stop is UK for period.)

![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/1punct-m005.png){: .man}\
Manual: hyphen, dash

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/1punct-r03.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: hyphen, dash




#### Initial Capitals 

Indicated in a few ways. See S to distinguish intial S from initial P. (S is vertical.)

![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/1capitals-m005.png){: .man}\
Manual: Jack, Clay, S.E., L.S.W.R. (London and South West Rail Company)

## Joining Vowels Sounded Individually and Diphthongs

Some concepts are under the prominent letter, instead of the first in the group.


### Vowels Sounded Individually

Leave the angle between the vowels. For ao/oa, leave a gap.

Check both orders of vowels to see all example words.

![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/1vow-sep-m004.png){: .man}\
Manual: re-enter, Oölite, Deä, create, Leo, fiasco, serious, fuel, poem

![shorthand image](assets/teach-1-bits/1vowindiv-t104.jpg){: .teach1}\
Teaching 1: oar, Laon

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/1vow-indiv-r03.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: re-enter, boa, chaos, co-operate, Leo, fiasco, fuel, poem, serious

Counter-example: In *abbreviation*, Callendar writes AI instead of IA, and rounds the corner even though the vowels are sounded separately.

![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/1vow-sep-counterexample-m014.png){: .man}\
Manual, Specimen of Fully Written: \
abbreviation, which are illustrated in the sections that follow,



### Vowels Sounded Together, Diphthongs

Orthic uses an older definition of the word *diphthong*.

![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/1diphth-m004.png){: .man}\
Manual: ai, oy, ou, eau

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/1dipth-r03.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: ai, oy, ou, eau

An upstroke vowel following or preceeding Y is written with an angle. (Teaching 1)

![shorthand image](assets/teach-1-bits/ye,obey-t104.jpg){: .teach1-1row}\
Teaching 1: ye, obey





### A



#### A with E,I,Y

See S for AYS.

![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/a-diphth-m006.png){: .man}\
Manual: ai, au, ay, days, quay, says, hay

![shorthand image](assets/teach-1-bits/dear-t104.jpg){: .teach1-1row}
![shorthand image](assets/teach-1-bits/dear-wrong-t104.jpg){: .teach1-1row}
![shorthand image](assets/teach-1-bits/demr-t104.jpg){: .teach1-1row}\
Teaching 1: dear, dear(wrong), demr

![shorthand image](assets/teach-1-bits/meal-t104.jpg){: .teach1-1row}
![shorthand image](assets/teach-1-bits/mail-t104.jpg){: .teach1-1row}\

![shorthand image](assets/teach-1-bits/may-t104.jpg){: .teach1-1row}\
Teaching 1: day, dm(wrong), dm or dny, may

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/a-r07.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: afar, ai, au, ay, ays

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/ai-r05.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: ai, ai, aim, nail

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/ay-r05.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: ay, ay, pay, may, d, j, m, n, q, t\
day, jay, dismay, nay, quay, Tay

The pattern seems to be use the downward form after an upstroke. (Cricket)

Teaching 1 gives several examples of what might happen if you use the wrong order.

Teaching 1 recommends that AI always be written in AI order, regardless of surrounding letters, but does not say why. IA is written IA. It also recommends dotting the I. The Manual and Supplement do not have any counter-examples. Revised does not mention the rule, and even has a counter-example.

#### AO, OA, AU

![shorthand image](assets/teach-1-bits/oar,laon-t104.jpg){: .teach1}\
Teaching 1: oar, Laon

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/au-r05.jpg){: .teach1}\
Revised: au, audit, landau

Write A above O, possibly towards the correct end of the O.

An upstroke vowel following or preceding Y is written with an angle. - Teaching

![shorthand image](assets/teach-1-bits/obey,ye-t104.jpg){: .teach1-1row}\
Teaching 1: ye, obey





## Joining Consonants

Some concepts are under a letter other than the first, if the other letter is sounded more strongly, or it makes for a more sensible explanation.

### A -- With Consonants

All examples from the Manual are under Joining Vowels with Vowels.

A on the line is *a*. A raised is *and*.

![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/a-above-and-m015.png){: .man}\
Manual: and

### B

![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/b-m006.png){: .man}\
Manual: bd, rob'd, bj, object, bl, able, br, bray, bs, absurd, bt, subtract, bv, subvent

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/b-r04.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: black, sensible, bleak, trebly\
Reversed B is only in Revised.

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/b-r07.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: bd, bf, bg, bh, abhor, bj, bk, bl, bl, bl, bm, bn, bp, bq, br, brain, bs, bt, bv, by, bz



BE-: See Abbreviating Principles.

BL can be shown by reversing the direction of the B loop, and optionally writing the L inside the B. (Only in Revised)(Revised, pg 4, Compound Characters)




### C

CH is included here because it's presented with C. Further details are under H.

![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/c-m007.png){: .man}\
Manual: ck, suckle, cl, close, cr, crutch, ct

![shorthand image](assets/teach-1-bits/chl,chr-t105.jpg){: .teach1}\
Teaching 1: chlo, chro

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/c-r07.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: cd, ch, chl, chr, aches, pitch'd, filches, pilchard, ck, cl, cm, cn, cqu, cr, cs, ct, cy

![shorthand image](assets/supp-bits/transact-s.png){: .sup}\
Supplement: transact

CH is a circle the same size as H. H, CH and WH are described under H. Note MCH, NCH, SCH have different rules, described with H.

CHL, CHR: Put the L or R inside the larger circle. Observe the L or R lies above/below the vowel line.

I think CHL and CHR turn in different directions, so the small circle just continues the motion. (Cricket)

CT: Supplement merges them (*transact*), as for GD. Manual Ordinary does not. Manual Hints for Reporting does not. (*characters*) 

CD: blends so it looks like a C with a long, very long, bottom. This rule isn't stated, but there are many examples in the Dictionary. Search for CED. No sign of CT doing the same. (Cricket)

![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/convinced-m019.png){: .man1row}\
Manual Ordinary Style: convinced

TCH. See Abbreviating Principles

### D

![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/d-m007.png){: .man}\
Manual: dge, judge, dj, dle, fiddle, dr, dread, dv, dw, dwell

![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/d-m014.png){: .man}\
Manual: student

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/d-r07.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: d, t, df, dge, dh, dj, dk, dle, dm, dn, dre, ds, dt, dv, dw, dy, dz

DEN series. In DN the letters form a wave. The end of one letter and the beginning of the next share a line. In DEN, the combination begins and ends on the same line. In DEEN, there is actually a line This is what most beginning writers think DEN should look like. I cannot find anywhere this is stated clearly, but it is consistent across all 4 books. (Cricket)

DD, DT and TD can be written as a double-wide D. See Abbreviating Principles.

DV can be written as a double-wide V. See Abbreviating Principles.

### E -- With Consonants

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/e-r07.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: ea, ee, ei, eu, ew, few

All examples from the Manual are under Joining Vowels with Vowels.

EC, ENC, IC, INC: This is often tricky, but fortunately the word is usually clear from context. There are no rules, but many examples in the dictionary. (Cricket)

EC: Make sure you do not go down as I changes to C. The first part of the C retraces part of the I. There are many examples in the dictionary, but they're all burried in a large plate.

ENC: Make sure that you do a full N. The first part of the C does not retrace any part of the N. 



### F

![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/f-m008.png){: .man}\

F is joined without an angle after vowels.

FR: Vowel comes off the top to save time and going around the circle twice. See R for rule. Examples: afraid (above) and fray (Manual, L)

FS: S curves upwards to the left. (Revised)

### G

![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/g-m008.png){: .man}\

![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/h-m008.png){: .man}\
Manual (H): ha, cha, hat, chat, what, which

See below for Revised.

H, CH, and WH are all large circles, and described here for easy comparison. All books agree that H is above the line and is written ccw, unless following S or P. Most agree that CH is cw and below the line.

Most of the time, it is safe, and faster, to omit the H in WH. There are, however, times when you need to record the exact spelling. I prefer to start WH at the bottom, to make an enlarged W, or to start it at the right, instead of at the top.

#### H: CH

Note the different ways of writing *school* or *scholar*.

MCH: Teaching Part 1 Common Words (below)

NCH and SCH can be written without an angle or break – ie in the other direction, still below the line. (Supplement) 

NCH and SCH without angle might mean changing direction. The Supplement also shows MCH doing the same. (Cricket)

I don't see why it has to turn ccw in the first place. It doesn't change the look in most cases. Perhaps it's a mnemonic (C), or a way to keep it a circle instead of a loop, or to ensure the preceeding letter doesn't curve. (Cricket)

Revised gives even more options, including writing above the line.

#### H: WH

Each writer has a slightly different way to write WH. I leave out the H. It's easy to read without. (Cricket)

![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/h-m012.png){: .man}\

HR, HL: Small circle inside big circle.


THR, THER: T can be omitted.

See P for PH, PHTH and PTH. Sometimes the H turns in the opposite direction.

See SH and TH for those joins. Sometimes H is smaller or not completed.

CHL:   `cl`\
(Supplement, Notes on Reporting, no examples)\




### I -- With Consonants

All examples from the Manual are under Joining Vowels with Vowels.

![shorthand image](assets/teach-1-bits/it-t107.jpg){: .teach1}\
Teaching 1: it

Stevens (Teaching, Psalms) I below the line in short words such as IN. This is not in any rules.

IC vs INC: This is often tricky, but fortunately the word is usually clear from context. If you need to make it clear, see advice under EC. (Cricket)

ING: See Abbreviating Principles.

KS: S joined to the finish of F or K is better turned up rather than down. (Teaching 1)

K replaced with mode 3. Only for take, sake, and their inflections. (Teaching 1)

I don't like this. Take / tag can be used as noun and verb. Too much chance of confusion. Sake is probably safe. An entire rule for two root words. One isn't safe and the other isn't a common word. I'd ignore this rule. (Cricket)

KR: Vowel comes off the top to save time and going around the circle twice. See R for rule. Examples: None, but it makes sense that the rule applies to KR since it applies to FR.

### L

![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/l-m009.png){: .man}\

flay, fray, whirl, walrus,\
lb, lc, lch, lchr, ld, lf, lg, lh, lk, lm, ln, lp, lr, ls, lt, lv, ly

When standing by itself as an initial, L or R is prefixed by a short stroke showing its direction. In other cases the distinction is obvious.

BL and BR are a bit tricky.

RT, TR: The circle is so small that it can fit nicely inside T, for RT and TR. (Cricket)

Note how downstrokes come off the bottom: lc, ld, lf, lg, lt. (Cricket)

Other shorthand systems (notably Gregg) base direction on the surrounding strokes. This can get confusing when switching systems. Each Orthic book has a mnemonic or two to help. (Cricket)

PH: H might be on either side depending on following letter.

PHL, PHR: small circle goes inside the H.

PR: Vowel comes off the top to save time and going around the circle twice. See R for rule. Examples: present, proof (Manual, Alphabet), present (Manual, P)

PS, SP, SPS: S is more shallow and the angle is rounded.

PHTH, PTH: Careful penmanship.

Note that this rule does not apply to SH! (Cricket)

PW uses angle-W but has no examples. (Revised)



### Q

![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/q-m010.png){: .man}\
Manual: esquire

![shorthand image](assets/teach-1-bits/q-t106.jpg){: .teach1}\
Teaching 1: q

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/q-r09.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: q

The position of Q on the line varies with writer. (The Alphabet has an example from the Manual.)

All four books state that Q is always followed by U, and thus U can be omitted. This is outdated.

My suggestion (Cricket):

- If you are confident you will remember how to spell the word, use just the loop, as Callendar recommends.

To clearly state the spelling, two ideas come to mind:

- If written normally, it's QU. To remove the U draw an X across the bottom loop, or close to it. To confirm that yes, you checked the spelling and the U belongs, draw a checkmark in the same place.

 - Otherwise, do what some phonetic writers do: Write the shorthand outline during dictation and mark it to confirm spelling later. Then write the standard spelling in a gap left after the shorthand outline,  in the margin, or the back of your notebook. I recommend margin (fast and visible) and back of book (findable).





### R

![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/r-m010.png){: .man}\
Manual: fierce, rd, rt, rf, rk, work, rn, learn, rp, rs, rv

![shorthand image](assets/teach-1-bits/rh-t105.jpg){: .teach1}\
Teaching 1: rha, rha ?? \
I think the 2nd one is HR, also used for THR. (Cricket)

![shorthand image](assets/teach-1-bits/pra-t105.jpg){: .teach1}\
Teaching 1: pra

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/rc-r04.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: rd, force, tierce, mercy, farcical

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/r-r09.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: rb, rce, rch, rd, rf, rg, barge, serge, rh, rhyme, Rhine, catarrh, rk, rl, rd, rm, rn, rp, rqu, rs, rt, rv, ry, rz

Manual: proof (alphabet), present (P) -- to show PR.

See L for details and contrasting examples.

RCE: Written like lower-case E, according to the Manual. As near as I can tell, Callendar makes a slight angle at just before the R, so your pen goes to the right and the R is closer to being a circle. If you're happy making R a loop instead of a circle, this complexity can be avoided. (Cricket)

RH: The R can lie just outside, or curl within, the H circle. (Teaching 1)

PR: It is usual to write a vowel following R attached to an upright letter from the top, as in PRA, to save time, and to avoid going round the circle twice. (Teaching 1, Lesson 3, L and R)

Teaching gives the example PRA, doesn't say here that it doesn't apply to S (see SH), and doesn't say which the other upright letters are. My best guess follows. (Cricket)

Following the tradition, I will make a mnemonic: *Shoot off the top.* (Cricket)

![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/sh-text-m011.png){: .man}\
Manual: sh, sha, sr, shed, Tisri, shred, school

In the compound Sh the h circle is made smaller for neatness; sh is distinguished from sr by the way it is joined. Thus compare shed, Tisri, shred, school.

![shorthand image](assets/teach-1-bits/pra-t105.jpg){: .teach1}\
Teaching 1: pra

It is usual to write a vowel following R attached to an upright letter from the top, as `pra`. This is to save time, and to avoid going round the circle twice.


![shorthand image](assets/teach-1-bits/sh-t106.jpg){: .teach1}\
Teaching 1: shro, sho

If the combination SHR is desired, it is shown by continuing the next letter from the bottom, instead of the top of the circle, as shro, but sho.

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/sc,sh-r04.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: p4: scr, scrap, sr, disrank, sh, shop, shrink, push, wash

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/s-r09.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: p9: sb, sc, sch, sh, shr, sk, sl, sm, sn, sp, sph, squ, st, sw, sy, scream, misread

Stevens doesn't show SR. He usually follows Callendar, so maybe it's ok for SR and SHR to share.

SHR: Very tiny R inside the small H. (It doesn't have to be a circle, just enough to look like you tried. Cricket).

I'm not sure whether to recommend following Callendar or Stevens. Callendar's is complete. Stevens wrote a lot more material, but there are only a few examples (except maybe in the Bible passages) so his way won't be reinforced. (Cricket)

### Other S Joins

![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/s-cap-m011.png){: .man}\
Manual: S.E.

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/ays-r06.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: ays, pays, ways, says, prays

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/a-r07.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: afar, ai, au, ay, ays

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/oys-r06.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: oys, cloys, employs

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/s-r09.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: sb, sc, sch, sh, shr, sk, sl, sm, sn, sp, sph, squ, st, sw, sy, scream, misread

S is vertical when written alone, to differentiate from E.

AYS/OYS: works better with Clarey's writing, whose Y goes down more steeply, than for Callendar. (See Vowels, AY, says)

FS, KS: S curves up to the left. This may work better with Clarey's writing style than the others. See F and K.

MBS, MPS: See M.

NCH, SCH: See H.

SP, SPS: See P.

SW: See W for alternate form of W.














### T

![shorthand image](assets/teach-1-bits/th-t106.jpg){: .teach1}\
Teaching 1: TH

![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/t-m011.png){: .man}\
with, both, tch, sketch, tle, turtle, tr, truth, tw, two

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/th-r04.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: th, this, threw, th-final, worth, faith

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/t-r09.jpg){: .rev}\
t, tb, tc, tch, th, with, tl, tr, tw, ty

Write TH in order.

TH-final: Don't close the H.

Callendar writes "month" with the final H almost completely closed, and not very circular. (Supplement, Examples of Abbreviations, below.)

TH-initial: See Abbreviating Principles for raised mode. Optional.

THER: H with R inside. Omit the T. (Same as HR.)

See Abbreviating Principles, TH- for TH at the beginning of a word.




### U -- With Consonants

All examples from the Manual are under Joining Vowels with Vowels.

see E, Joining Vowels, for E vs U

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/u-r09.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: u, ee, sum, see, ua, ue, ui


### V

![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/v-m012.png){: .man}\
Manual: minster (not minister), Minver, stew, view

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/v-r09.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: v, ste, view, stew

V is distinguished from ste by its size.

See Abbreviating Principles: EV for all vowel-V-vowel combinations.

### W

![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/w1-m012.png){: .man}\
Manual: way, woe, wet, write

![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/w2-m012.png){: .man}\
Manual: sews, cows, laws, wk, hawk, wl, owls, wn, dawn

![shorthand image](assets/teach-1-bits/w-t106.jpg){: .teach1}\
Teaching 1: wo, ow, owing, owing, wd, wd, sw.

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/sw-r04.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: sw, swam, swear, answer

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/w-r05.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised:\
wh, whose, when, chose, chin\
wr, wring, thing\
ws, pews, rows, frowsy

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/w-r09.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: w, wd, wh, wk, wl, wn, wr, th, ws, saws, news, wy, snowy, sinewy, dewy

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/would,world-r19.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: hood, would, world, might, ment


W goes upwards. C and F go downwards.

Use left-W at the beginning of a word, except before R. It can start at the 3:00 position, to form 3/4 of a circle, for ease of writing. Again, there is an exception: WR goes ccw. (Cricket)

Another way to remember *W* is to point out that whether initial or final, *it is an upward tick*. The letter may be written either circularly or angularly. (Teaching 1)

Note Calendar (Revised) differs, for *would* and *world*.

SW: The angular form of W is used after S. (Teaching 1; demonstrated but not explained in Manual)

Change the exit angle of W to blend with the following letter.

WR: Distinguished from TH by its size.

WH: See H.

WS final: The addition of S forms a loop.

WK, WL, WN: Notice how the letters blend. (Cricket)




### X

![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/x-m012.png){: .man}\
Manual: xh, xp, xt, extent, exhort, expense

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/x-r05.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised:\
xc, excel, exclaim\
xh, exhale, xch\
xp, expel, export\
st, extent, text

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/x-r10.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: x, xc, xch, xh, xp, xqu, xt

*X* is made up, as in longhand, of *C* and *S*. (Teaching 1)

You can often omit the S, or merge the S with the following letter. (Cricket)

There is no need to make an angle in the combinations *Exh*, *Exch*. (Manual)

### Y -- With Consonants
![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/y-m012.png){: .man}\
Manual: yacht, yet, yore yule

![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/y-unaltered-m015.png){: .man}\
Manual: applied, tries, easiest, happiest, `aplyd, trys, easyst, hapyr`

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/y-r10.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: y

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/y-r11.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: flies, tries, said, drier, `flys, trys, sayd, dryr`

Let Y stand unaltered. In adding inflections to words ending in y, the y is not changed to i or ie.

Teaching 1: list but no shorthand\
tries -> `trys`,  applies -> `applyd`




### Z
![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/z-m012.png){: .man}\
Manual: daze, Fitz, puzzle

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/z-r10.jpg){: .rev}\

## General Methods of Abbreviation, Including Ordinary Style

The most important rule of all in reporting practice is never to use a mode or an abbreviation that causes hesitation or waste of time, not to worry about trifles; and to practise writing from dictation and transcribing till your notes become perfectly fluent and cursive and legible. A study of-the examples which follow will probably be more useful than many pages of hints. (Supplement, Notes on Reporting)

### Omit A and O before M and N
![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/a-o-omit-m015.png){: .man}\
Manual: can, con, alone, woman, `cn, alne, wmn`

![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/a-o-omit-correct-m015.png){: .man}\
Manual: band, bond

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/am,om-r11.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: bank, common, alone, woman\
band, bond, dame, dome, gang, gong, tame, tome, wander, wonder


An omission of this kind can always be corrected by writing the omitted character above.

### General Method of Abbreviation Details

![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/1gen-abbr-m017.png){: .man}\
Manual: different, difference, acknowledge, especially, circumstance, extraordinary, representative

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/1abb-gen-mthd-r19.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised:\
acknowledge, especially, reference, regulation, extraordinary, ordinary, representative\
delete, erode, indeed, meet, read\
most, must, part, point, right\
head, hood, would, world, might, -ment

The general method of abbreviating long words is to write only the first syllable, and, if necessary, to indicate the termination by writing the last letter or two, separated by a small interval from the first part. (Manual)

The general method of abbreviating is the same as that ordinarily employed in longhand, namely, to write the first syllable of a word, and if necessary, to indicate the termination by writing the last lettrer or two separatated by a small interval from the first part. In many cases the termination may be joined, as in the examples. In the case of short words containing a characteristic long vowel or diphthong, it is generally better to keep the vowel. But in the case of very common words for which abbreviations are already current in longhand it is often better to follow the longhand usage. As in longhand, the same abbreviation may in some places be used for two, or even three, different words provided that they are different parts of speech such as would necessarily be distinguished by the context. The principle in itself is good and reasonable, but we would caution writers of Orthic against the abuse of it. (Revised)




### Modes or Positions

Each letter that can be replaced by a mode is listed under Joining Consonants. Their use for shortening words beyond simple letter replacement is under Abbreviating Principles. 

* First Position, Raised: B, P, TH, V (Supplement calls this Supra-Linear Writing)
  * B is only raised for the syllable B at the start of words.
  * TH is only raised at the start of words.
* Second Position, Normal (gap): all others
* Third Position: Lowered: G, J, K, L, QU

If the last part of the word is normally indicated by mode, use a dot.

The Manual clearly says and shows mode is relative to the previous letter. So does Revised. Teaching is the outlier, saying clearly "below the line," but the only examples work for both interpretations.

See below, especially:\
Manual: benevolent (Manual)\
Supplement: judge\
Revised: reign, intelligence, religion

[Jeremy: ‘Benevolent’ demonstrates how indication by mode differs from the fixed positions used in Pitman’s shorthand. While Pitman’s positions are relative to the line, Orthic’s modes are relative to the preceding character. Thus a raised N implies the prefix BE-, and then an LNT raised relative to that N implies the V.]

Mnemonic: The raised letters are in the front of the mouth. The lowered ones are in the back, except for L. (Cricket)

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/g,v,middle-r17.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: severe, reign, design, benevolent, benevolent (not recommended), prerogative, regular, reverend, several, alleiviate, elevate, intelligence, religion

In the middle of a short word, G or V may be conveniently expressed by the modes. In the case of longer words, it is generally better to keep the G or V if it forms part of the first syllable or the root of the word and to only express it by mode if it occurs in a subsequent syllable. (Revised)





### Drop the Dots

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/1dots-r11.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: is, if, in, it, apply, assist, cotton, fiddle

Dots are generally omitted in common words. This applies to I dot and doubling dot. (Manual)

Examples: Probably many including the words: in, it, if, him, his, will.

Drop them all, unless absoultely necessary. Be brave! (Cricket)

## Abbreviating Principles<br/>(Abbreviations, Prefixes, Suffixes, Slurs, Blends, Compound Characters, etc.)

Prefixes, suffixes, and common letter groups. Description is under the strongest sounding letter.

Look for patterns! Usually it's the key sounds.

It is clear that the shorthand chracters EVE must throw everything following the final E above the line., and it is also evident that such words cannot clash with that peculiarity of the English language TH, except in the words even and then. (Teaching 1)

Raised V can be used in any part of the word. Raised TH is only for the beginning (Teaching 1)

It is better to write the vowel after L and R, to show the direction. (Teaching 1)

Use a raised dot if eve was the last part of the word. (Teaching 1)

Note that *even* is written `een` instead of being raised, to distinguish it from *than* and *then*.

#### EX- `x`

As there is no English word beginning with *X* that is not preceded by *E*, this character may be used to represent *Ex*. (Manual)

As there is no English word beginning with X that is not preceded by E, this character may be used to represent EX. (Teaching 1)

Out of date! I recommend a similar procedure as for Q: Checkmark or X below the letter to show standard Orthic rules apply. If you want to be sure you spell it correctly, write the outline and the correct spelling in longhand in a standard place. (Cricket)

#### -FECTION `fun`

These and derived terminations are similarly expressed by a dot below and to the right to indicate the G. (Manual)

When the word is inflected, the last letter of the inflection takes the place of the dot. (Revised)

Some words are better written with the K and omitting the E. (Revised)\
...mostly 1-syllable words. (Cricket)



#### -GN `_n`

![shorthand image](assets/supp-bits/foreign-s.png){: .sup1row}
![shorthand image](assets/supp-bits/sign-s.png){: .sup1row}\

Teaching 1: gn, foreign, age, magnify

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/gn-r17.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: sign, impugn

Indicated by N written below to indicate the G.


#### -GRAM `_m`
![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/gram-r17.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: diagram

Indicated by M written below to indicate the g, similar to -gn. (Supplement)

Diagram is a good example of relative vs absolute positioning. (Cricket)


#### -GRAPH `ph`

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/graph-r20.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: lithograph, paragraph, geography

Supplement. No examples.

#### -GUE (One Syllable) `g`

Manhood has detatched HD in Manual, connected in Revised.

#### HYPER- -- See PR- Family.



#### -IGHT `_t`

![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/ight-m016.png){: .man}\
Manual: night, light, `n_t, le_t`

![shorthand image](assets/teach-1-bits/ight-t108.jpg){: .teach1}\
Teaching 1: Demonstrating how raising is just writing the word in full, then erasing the IGH.\
lite, right

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/ight-r17.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: sight, alight

It is better to show the vowel after I and R, so as to show which consonant it is by the way it is turned. (Teaching 1)

#### -IGNANT, -IGNITY `eg`

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/ignant,ignity-r20.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: indignant or indignity, dignity

#### INCOM- -- See COM-


#### -ING `(ing1), (ing2)`

![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/ing-m016.png){: .man}\
Manual: using, saying, seeming, king, sing, singing.\
`us(ing1), say(ing2), seem(ing2), king, sing, sing(ing2)`

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/ing-r12.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: \
ing (`ing1, ing2`), leasing, placing, praying, coming, \
king, bring, bringing, sing, singin, \
reading, blaming, sinning, setting, seeing, going, saying


This form is used only for the inflection "ing" and not in other words. It is better to curve the stroke after D,M,N,T,V and vowels. (Manual)

I vote we use it in sing and king. It's already used in thing and bring. (Cricket)

#### -ION `un` 

![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/ion-m016.png){: .man}\
Manual: action, `actn` \

![shorthand image](assets/teach-1-bits/ion-t108.jpg){: .teach1}\
Teaching 1: ion, action

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/ion-r12.jpg){: .rev}\
ion, position, passion, deception, action, section


Dotted if necessary. (Manual)

#### -IDE, -ITE `e`
![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/ide,ite-r21.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: confide, reside, smite, write

See -EDE for note.


#### -ISM `em` or `.m`
![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/ism-r19.jpg){: .rev}\
idealism, conservatism, socialism

Supplement uses `.m`, no examples.

#### -ITE See -IDE.

#### -ITY, -ETY, -IETY -- `^y`
![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/lty-m016.png){: .man}\
Manual: abilities, peculiarity, `ab^ys, pec^y` \
Note "abilities" -- y stands unaltered.

![shorthand image](assets/teach-1-bits/ly,ity-t108.jpg){: .teach1}\
Teaching 1: pitty, city, truly, nearly\
Words are FW and Abbreviated.

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/ety,lety,ity-r16.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: entirety, society, insanity, piety, pity

Teaching 1 specifically says "above/below the last letter," and explains that's where the Y would be if the whole word was written in Orthic. Looking at the examples, he means 3rd position (lower).

Note piety vs pity. (Revised)

#### -IVE -- See -VE.

#### -JECT `j`
![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/ject-r20.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: inject, project, reject

#### -KE -- See -GE

Manual: thankless, fearlessness, `^ankls, fear.lsns`

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/less-r12.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: ls, useless, unless, fearless

#### -LTH `th`

L maybe slurred with the T in such words as wealth, health, etc. (Teaching 1)

From other examples, I think this means L can be omitted. (Cricket)

#### -LY `_y`
![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/ly-m016.png){: .man}\
Manual: nearly, easily, dailies, `near_y, easy_y, day_ys`

![shorthand image](assets/teach-1-bits/ly,ity-t108.jpg){: .teach1}\
Teaching 1: pitty, city, truly, nearly\

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/ly-r17.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: lowly, finely, fearfully, nearly, only

Note *dailies* in Manual: Vowels in order for smoothest writing; y stands unaltered twice in dailies.

In practice, the Y may generally be joined. (Revised)

After a mode, the LY would be written in full. (Revised)

#### MAGNGA-, MAGUE-, MAGNI- `m_`

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/mag-r016.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: magnanimity, magnetic, magnify



#### MANGA-, MAGNI- `m_`

![shorthand image](assets/supp-bits/magnify-s.png){: .sup1row}\
Supplement: magnify

Written m, the rest of the word being placed below to indicate the g. (Supplement)

#### -MB-, -MBS- `(mb)`


![shorthand image](assets/supp-bits/mb,mp-s.png){: .sup1row}\
Supplement: mb, mp

![shorthand image](assets/teach-1-bits/mb-t114.jpg){: .teach1}\
Teaching 1: mb, member, dv

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/mb-r04.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: timber, lumper, lamb, temper, lumper, lamp

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/mbs-r06.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: mbs, kembs, climbs, numbs\

May be written with a single character somewhat like mp , but beginning and ending on the line. (Supplement)

Note: Only when preceded by E, I and U upstroke vowels. (Revised) It looks like the vowel is combined with the start of M. (Cricket)

#### -MENT   `mt `

![shorthand image](assets/teach-1-bits/ment-t109.jpg){: .teach1}\
Teaching 1: `mt` 

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/ment-r12.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: mt, payment, raiment, moment


#### MIS- `ms`

![shorthand image](assets/supp-bits/mis,mistake-s.png){: .sup1row}\
Supplement: mis, mistake

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/mis-r11.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: mis, ms, misuse, mislay, misnomer

Written ms, omitting the i. 

#### MM, MN `mm, mn`

![shorthand image](assets/teach-1-bits/mm-t114.jpg){: .teach1}\
Teaching 1: mm, mn

Double-wide M. Vowel is left out. (Teaching 1)

#### NCH -- See H.


#### -NESS `.es`
![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/ness-m016.png){: .man}\
Manual: happiness, thoughtfulness, `hapyns, ^otfl.ns` -- ***Deprecated***

![shorthand image](assets/supp-bits/goodness-s.png){: .sup1row}\
Supplement: goodness

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/ness-r12.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: ns, slyness, faithfulness, senselessness

Note in thoughtfulness that ns is not marked as raised. It is in position 2, and positions are relative.

This termination should be written ‑ess detached, by the general rule, and not ns as given in the Manual. [E.g. goodness.] Detached n and ns can then be used, as in longhand, for the expression of the common terminations ‑ation and ‑ations. (Suplement)


#### -NG -- See ING.

#### -ODE, -OTE `o`
![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/ode,ote-r21.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: explode, strode, promote, wrote.


#### -OLOGY `ogy`
Supplement, Notes on Reporting.

#### -OLUTE, -UDE, -UTE `u`
![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/olute,ude,ute-r21.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: absolute, denude, mute\
Words which might clash: incide/incite, rede/ride/rite, side/site, mode/mote, rode/rote, delude/dilute, illude/elude

Again, too many clashes for my taste! (Cricket)


#### -OLVE -- See -VE

#### -ORY -- See -ARY

#### -OSION, -OTION `oun`

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/osion,otion-r20.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: explosion, lotion

#### -OTE See -ODE

#### -OUD, -OUT, -OUND, -OUNT -- See -OUND, -OUNT

#### -OUGH `o`
![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/ough-m016.png){: .man}\
Manual: ought, brought

![shorthand image](assets/teach-1-bits/ought-t109.jpg){: .teach1}\
Teaching 1: ought, thought

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/ough-r12.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: o, brought, plough

#### -OUND, -OUNT `ou`

![shorthand image](assets/teach-1-bits/ound,ount-t110.jpg){: .teach1}\
Teaching 1: round, sound, count, counter, county, country

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/oud,out,ount,ount-r20.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: cloud, clout, aloud, route, astound, hound, account, recount\
Words which may clash: mound / mount, round / rout\
Clarey wrote `klou` for cloud. I suspect he did it because it's easier to write, and, if he comes from a phonetic system it makes no difference, but he forgot to mention it as a rule.

Revised warns about the clash, but doesn't say how to deal with it. Keeping the extra letters will probably work. (Cricket)

Note the final E in route.




There are examples of this in the Supplement, but it isn't listed as a rule. It is listed as a rule in Teaching 1.

#### OVE, OLVE -- See VE.

#### PR- Family

Someone needs to dive into this a bit more, but on first glance it appears all PRv and PvR at start of word are treated the same. Super/supra differently. So why do all the books separate them? (Cricket)


#### PER-, PRO-, PRE-, PARA-, PARI-, PRI-, PUR-, maybe PRA- `^`
![shorthand image](assets/supp-bits/person-s.png){: .sup1row}

Supplement: perceives, person

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/per,pre,pro-r15.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: person, present, proclaim, persecute, promise, premise, profane, profess, superfine, supralinear.

![alt shorthand image](assets/revised-split/pr-fam-r16.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: primary, private, purchase, purvey\
parallel, period, perimeter

Pre- and pro- are distinguished from per, if necessary, by retaining the vowels e and o. The cases, however, in which it is necessary to make the distinction are very rare. (Supplement) (Revised)

If working in a field you are not familiar with, it's probably best to keep the vowel. The cases are not rare! (Cricket)

When any of these prefixes occur in the middle of a word after another prefix, as in the words unbelief, compromise, etc., they are expressed by Mode (1) (raised), that is to say by writing the terminal portion of the word close above and to the right of the initial prefix. [E.g. comprehend.] In the prefixes super, supra, hyper, the per is similarly expressed. (Supplement) (unbelief, compromise, hyper do not have written examples.)

The allied prefix pri may be expressed in the same way as pre in some common words. [E.g., private.] (Supplement)

Only for prefixes, or quazi prefixes (Teaching 1)

Always write O before F. (Why?) (Revised)

In the prefixes super, supra, hyper, the per is expressed by writing the terminal portion of the word close above and to the right of the initial prefix. Thus superfine, supralinear. (Revised)

#### SCH -- See CH, Abbreviating Principles and SH

#### -SHIP `.p` or `p`
![shorthand image](assets/supp-bits/worship-s.png){: .sup1row}\
Supplement: worship

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/ship-r20.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: fellowship, friendshp, worship

In accordance with the general method terminations are indicated by writing the last letter or two detached from the rest of the word. (Supplement, exact quote)

But...the only example in the Supplement is not detatched.

Revised, looks like it's connected, and separated in the first example for ease of writing, not to detatch it for the termination.



#### -STRUCT `str`
![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/struct-r20.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: instruct, obstructing, destructive

#### SUPER-, SUPRA -- See PER.

#### -T

T may generally be slurred in the terminations ty (20) and th, thus duy = duty, wih = with, ohr = other. (Supplement, Notes on Reporting)

T may be slurred (omitted) in such words as duty, bounty, etc. (Teaching 1)\
Supplement said it better. (Cricket)




#### TCH `ch`

No examples in Supplement and Teaching 1.

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/tch-r12.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: ch, fetch, match, crutch


The t may always be omitted in this combination. (Supplement, Teaching 1)




#### TD -- See DD.

although

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/th-r15.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: than, that, the, them, there, this, those, though, thus, thy, thing\
I think they knew him then.

Use raised-mode only when TH begins the word, except in the case of the word *although*. (Teaching 1)

T may generally be slurred in the termination -th. (Manual, Notes on Reporting)

Other egs: *with, other*.

The only case of a word written above the line and not presupposing initial Th is the word “and” signified by a, written above the line. (Teaching 1)\ 
...What about words starting Be? (Cricket)





#### -THER `(ther)`

![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/ther-m016.png){: .man}\
Manual: ther, others, ard, toward

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/ther-r12.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: ther, hr, other, mother, rather, either

![shorthand image](assets/teach-1-bits/ther-t109.jpg){: .teach1}\

![shorthand image](assets/supp-bits/selves-s.png){: .sup1row}\
Supplement: arrive, gives, given, selves

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/ive,ve-r16.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: leave, cove, give, saves, lived, given, loving, grove, novel, movement, prove, solve, shoving, involved

A dot above and to the right of the word to indicate the V. When the word is inflected the last letter of the inflection is substituted for the dot.

When the word is inflected, the last letter of the inflection is substituted for the dot. (Revised)\
...Only the last letter? (Cricket)

In words ending in *ove* or *olve*, it is generally better to omit the *o* or *ol* and to write the v. (Revised)

See Modes for Revised's warnings about over-use.


#### WARD `ard`
![shorthand image](<assets/manual-bits/ward-with-ther-m016 copy.png>){: .rev}\
Manual: hr, others, ward, towards

Revised: likewise, otherwise, unwise

Why not keep the W? (Cricket)


#### X- -- See EX- and X (Joining Consonants)


#### -YING `ing1`
![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/ying-r20.jpg){: .rev}\
Revised: conveying, crying, dying, flying

Flying looks like fling. (Cricket)


## Phrases

Note: Time is saved by writing without hesitation, not writing fewer lines at the expense of more thought. Do not go overboard with phrasing. (Many books on Gregg.)

The last rule is an important one and should be thoughtfuly remembered. "Never try to contract if it is easier to write in full or if it porduces hesitation." (Teaching 1)

Apparently there's a "list of recognized contractions as issued by the Society (Teaching 1, Lesson 9) but I haven't seen it. (Cricket)

### Phrases in Manual

![shorthand image](assets/manual-bits/1gen-phrases-m017.png){: .man}\
Manual: able to do; as it is; I am not; I have had; I shall be very; to be; ought to have been; with a view to.

"With a view to" is not worth phrasing for modern material. (Cricket)

![shorthand image](assets/revised-split/1phraseology-r24.jpg)

Time is frequently saved and legibility increased by joining words togethre in phrases without lifting the pen. This applies especially to commmon words, auxiliaries and particles.

This is a powerful method of abbreviation in the hands of experienced writers, and is specially appliable in the case of Orthic owing to its lineality and facility of joining. A reckless use of phraseography, however, is strongly to be condemned. Experience ahs shown that beginners are apt to run riot with all sorts of impossible and useless phrases, to the greeat detriment of the speed and legiblity of their writing. The student shoudl therefore exercise the greatest caution at the outset i his use of phraseolgraphy.

He must remember that:
- abbreviated words canot be freely joined wihtout danger of clashing;
- time is not saved by joinig words which join awkwardly or indistinctly; and
- phrases which are so long that they cannot be written easily without shifting the hand can be written more clearly and quickly if divided.

#### Examples of Abbreviations, Revised page 22,23

Derivatives of words are abbreviated in the same way as the word except:
- adjust in the same way as just
- remember in the same way as member
- party and particular are abbreviated like part
- county and country like count

(Runon sentence reorganized by Cricket.)

The two forms of ea are used repsectively for each and eat. They may be generally applied. For instance, in such words as beach and teach, the former abbreviation would be used, while in the case of words like beat and heat the latter abbreviation would be used. Peach should be written in full to distinguish it from pea. Note also the word preach.

(Why aren't these with the others?)
