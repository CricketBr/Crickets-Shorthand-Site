# Orthic Consolidated – Reference DRAFT

## Being Improved and Expanded Consolidation of Various Books with Clarifications, Additions, Warnings, and Opinions of the Author, and Others who Might Comment


# Notes to Self

- The first part, how to write and join, will be sorted by longhand, with a few cross-references when several letters should be combined to clarify the differences.
- If it's not obvious where the full description should be, choose the earlier one.
- Assume readers have read the Manual. This is a review. Readers can see the arrows on the images.
- Abbreviation and Vocab sections assume reader knows Joins. Jeremy's notation is enough for them to make the image on their own. (Will need to add to the notation.)

-- using my own? combined letters/slurs/joins are in brackets, not codes
- Abbreviation and Vocab can sort either way (Orthic or English).
- The two ways of spelling are Orthic and orthographic. If I find a better word for the 2nd I can search/replace easily enough.
- xxx is note to self. Searching for them will be one of the final steps before publicataion.
- xxx add notation to the alphabet?
- xxx ??? Do I need to list the source along with the word in the text, for joins? Probably not. It's in the image.
- images -- file name is topic, book, page

- where a rule is not contradicted by later books, only the oldest is quoted, unless later books have better explanations or examples.

# Introduction to Orthic Consolidated – Reference Alphabet

[Introduction to Orthic Consolidated Series](orth-cnsl-intro.md)

Sometimes (more often than I'd like), I want to look up a rule. Searching four separate books, which often disagree about which style level a rule applies to and sometimes have an entirely different rule, is annoying and frustrating. (One could argue, correctly, that if I'd spent enough time learning at the start, I would not need this reference.)

This book intends to solve that problem. It combines all the rules (except those that only exist in the reporting style) from the Manual, Supplement, Teaching Parts 1 and 2, and Revised. It includes references to the sources for easy confirmation of the rules. (I lied. I included some rules that I like that are only in the reporting style.)

It is *not* intended as an introduction to Orthic. The Manual or Revised is best for that. (I recommend the Manual, and anything Revised does differently just feels wrong to anyone who started with the Manual.)

It is organized into the following parts: 

* Alphabet. Not really necessary by the time you're here.
* Non-Alphabet Rules. Rules that don't apply to a specific letter.
* Joining Characters
  * Vowel-Vowel
  * Consonants and Vowels

  
*If not stated, the rule comes from The Manual.* The wording of each rule is a combination of the original sources and my own understanding. I have made very little effort to clarify who said what, but much effort to show where the concept was introduced. Note that, since it's difficult not to pick up the original accent, you cannot rely on that to separate my words from any other author's.

# The Alphabet
![alphabet, manual](assets/manual-bits/_alphabet-m003.png)
Manual: ab, act, bad, cabby, adder, fed, left, get, hit, city, jug, luck, like, melt, know, proof, plate, query, roller, sort, trust, upper, wavy, wow, exit, eyes, size

# Notation

Use the joining rules below unless otherwise specified.

Letters in brackets are compound letters or slurs.

* ^ indicates the following letters are raised.
* . indicates a small gap to indicate omitted letters, as in Mode 2.
* _ indicates the following letters are lowered.
* \* indicates a dot on the line (or a tiny bit above)
* : indicates a sharp join between vowels. Otherwise all vowels have rounded joins.
* I indicates dotted i. E is used if the dot is optional.
* Dot for doubled letters is not included.
* () indicates a compound letter.
* vowels are listed in order written.

Where there is more than one way to write a letter or compound, I added numbers. Often the number chosen reflects the shape of the compound, as a mnemonic. This was not always possible.

**ing**  
(ing1) = straight, (ing2) = curved, chosen because 1 is straight and 2 is curved. (Cricket)


# General Rules and Simple Abbreviations

### Doubling a Letter

![double letters, manual](assets/manual-bits/_doubled-ltrs-m003.png)
Manual: odd, too, ee, sleep, sup

### Two Sizes of Letters
Most books say use 1:3, but then use less in the Two Sizes image, and somewhere between 1:2 and 1:3 in actual writing. It's rarely a problem except for debates between students.

![two sizes, manual](assets/manual-bits/_two-sizes-m005.png)
Manual: st, ste, en, ens, inst, nt, er, ers, abs, against, epitaph

> The actual **size** of the characters may be varied according to circumstances, such as the goodness of the light and the writing materials. The minuteness of any kind of writing is limited by the size of the smallest characters. In Orthic the small size may be made as small as desired, and the small circle may be reduced to a dot. But it is best to make the small characters about one-twelfth of an inch \[2.1mm\] long, and the large ones twice as big." (Revised, p3, General Rules)

### Position on the Line
The rules for this are a mess.

Just do what looks right to you. If you read something that doesn't make sense, remember some writers will write higher or lower than you do.

**Details:** In the Manual, Calendar claims the first letter sits on the line, then on the same page (Two Sizes of Character) starts *epitaph* above the line, with P sitting on the line. In St John II, *it* and *in* start on the line and go upwards. T is a downstroke, so the rule isn't first downstroke. Stevens has his own version. On the first page of the Preface to the New Testament <https://orthic.shorthand.fun/reading> *it* starts below the line and T sits on the line. Revised says, "The first letter of a word generally begins or ends on the line, but A, E and O may be raised when preceeding downstrokes." (Revised, General Rules, p3)

### Modes or Positions

Each letter that can be replaced by a mode is listed under Joining Consonants. Their use for shortening words beyond simple letter replacement is under Word Parts. 

Note that modes are relative to the preceding character. See "thoughtfulness" in Word Parts.

* First Position, Raised: B, P, V
* Second Position, Normal (gap): all others
* Third Position: Lowered: G, J, K, L, QU

The books claim this can be easily remembered by imagining where the rest of the word would be if the letter was not omitted. This is not actually true. (Cricket)

Note that the raised letters are in the front of the mouth. The lowered ones are in the back, except for L. (Cricket)

Why did they choose L and not R for this rule? (Cricket)



### Connecting Stroke

xxx A short connecting tick maybe used after ER, TH, etc, and when they are followed by G, P and S. (Revised, p3, General Rules) Note: This rule is only in Revised. Clarey may need this more than the other writers due to his different style of writing.

![Tick between letters](<alphabet images/tick between letters.png>) 
> dirge, faiths, serpents : Revised

### Dividing Words

![divided words, manual](assets/manual-bits/_divide-line-m005.png)
Manual: lawsuit, Woolwich, virgin

You can divide a word to keep it on the line. Beware that this might be confused with writing by mode.

### Punctuation
![punctuation, manual](assets/manual-bits/_punct-m005.png)
Manual: hyphen, dash

So they are not confused with raised A (and) and raised O (though).


Does this also apply to brackets, so they aren't confused with G and K?

### Initial Capitals 

Indicated in a few ways.
![capitals, manual](assets/manual-bits/capitals-m005.png)
Manual: Jack, Clay, S.E., L.S.W.R. (London and South West Rail Company)

See S to distinguish intial S from initial P.

### Omit A and O before M and N
![omit a,o, correction, manual](assets/manual-bits/a-o-omit-m015.png)
Manual: can, con, alone, woman, ```cn, aln, wmn```

![omit a,o, manual](assets/manual-bits/a-o-omit-correct-m015.png)
Manual: band, bond

An omission of this kind can always be corrected by writing the omitted character above.

# Diphthongs and Joining Vowels with Vowels

Some concepts are under the prominent letter, instead of the first in the group.

Orthic uses an older definition of the word *diphthong*.

![diphthongs intro, manual](assets/manual-bits/_diphth-m004.png)
Manual: ai, oy, ou, eau

## Vowels Sounded Individually

Check both orders of vowels to see all example words.

![vowels indiv, manual](assets/manual-bits/_vow-sep-m004.png)
Manual: re-enter, Oölite, Deä, create, Leo, fiasco, serious, fuel, poem

## A

![a diphthongs, manual](assets/manual-bits/a-diphth-m006.png)
Manual: ai, au, ay, days, quay, says, hay

The pattern seems to be use the downward form after an upstroke. (Cricket)

xxx Teaching1 suggests only using AI-under for AI, thus spelling it according to the common orthography. This rule is not in the Manual. The Dictionary (Manual and Supplement only) does not have any examples to the contrary. Optician uses the AI form. Social uses the IA form.. 

## E

![e diphthongs, manual](assets/manual-bits/e-diphth-m007.png)
Manual: ee, ei, ie, steep, stupid, eu, ew, new

![e vs u, manual](assets/manual-bits/e-vs-u-m012.png)
Manual: seen, sun

![ea diphthongs, manual](assets/manual-bits/ea-diphth-m007.png)
Manual: ea, seat, seas, reat, real, pearl, years

## I

![i diphthongs, manual](assets/manual-bits/i-diphth-m008.png)
Manual: social, optician, chief

## O
![o diphthongs, manual](assets/manual-bits/o-diphth-m010.png)
Manual: oar, or, oak, oi, toil, ou, out, oy, boys

## U
![u diphthongs, manual](assets/manual-bits/u-diphth-m012.png)
Manual: ua, guard, suit

## Y

No examples.

# Joining Consonants

Some concepts are under a letter other than the first, if the other letter is sounded more strongly, or it makes for a more sensible explanation.

## A

All examples from the Manual are under Joining Vowels with Vowels.

Omit A and O before M and N. See General Rules.

A on the line is *a*. A raised is *and*.
![and raised, manual](assets/manual-bits/a-above-and-m015.png)

## B

![b, manual](assets/manual-bits/b-m006.png)
Manual: bd, rob'd, bj, object, bl, able, br, bray, bs, absurd, bt, subtract, bv, subvent

B, G, J, K, L, P, QU and V can be omitted using modes.

xxx Be: This prefix is peculiar to a special class of English words, and may also be expressed by writing above the line. Note that been and being are chosen to not conflict with than and thing. (Supplement, and Teaching1 Lesson 6\)

xxx Supplement: be, been, being, than, thing ; Teaching1: behold, been better, best, by

xxx BL can be shown by reversing the direction of the B loop, and optionally writing the L inside the B. (Revised, pg 4, Compound Characters)

xxx Revised: BL, BL, black, sensible, bleak, trebly

## C

![c, manual](assets/manual-bits/c-m007.png)
Manual: ck, suckle, cl, close, cr, crutch, ct

CH is a circle the same size as H. H, CH and WH are described under H.

## D

![d, manual](assets/manual-bits/d-m007.png)
Manual: dge, judge, dj, dle, fiddle, dr, dread, dv, dw, dwell

xxx supplement omit D from adj-

![d student, manual](assets/manual-bits/d-m014.png)
Manual: student

DEN series. In DN the letters form a wave. The end of one letter and the beginning of the next share a line. In DEN, the combination begins and ends on the same line. In DEEN, there is actually a line This is what most beginning writers think DEN should look like. I cannot find anywhere this is stated clearly, but it is consistent across all 4 books. (Cricket)


xxx

DD, DT and TD can be written as a double-wide D. Supplement.



DV is slurred into one large compound character, deep and double-width. (Manual Reporting, Slurring; Supplement; Revised p4 Compound Characters)



* Supplement: no examples  
* Revised: advert, avert

## E

All examples from the Manual are under Joining Vowels with Vowels.

See Word Parts for initial EV.

## F

![f, manual](assets/manual-bits/f-m008.png)
Manual: if, ft, soft, fd, puff'd, fl, fr, rifle, afraid, fs, skiffs

F is joined without an angle after vowels.

xxx S joined to the finish of F or K is better turned up rather than down. (Teaching1)


xxx ks-correct, ks-not-recommended (Teaching1)

## G

![g, manual](assets/manual-bits/g-m008.png)
Manual: gh, high, gl, glory, gr, agree, gn, sign

B, G, J, K, L, P, QU and V can be omitted using modes.

## H, CH, and WH

Manual (H): cha, hat, chat, what, which
![h, manual](assets/manual-bits/h-m008.png)

H, CH, and WH are all large circles, and described here for easy comparison. All books agree that H is above the line and is written ccw -- most of the time. Most agree that CH is cw and below the line.

Most of the time, it is safe, and faster, to omit the H in WH. There are, however, times when you need to record the exact spelling. I prefer to start WH at the bottom, to make an enlarged W, or to start it at the right, instead of at the top.

Manual (CH): ch, chair, Christ, ache, ahead
![ch, manual](assets/manual-bits/ch-m006.png)
![ch, manual](assets/manual-bits/ch-m007.png)

Manual (W): who, ha (have)
![wh, manual](assets/manual-bits/h-m012.png)

xxx

get images from all writers -- some interesting variations

## H, Other Joins

HR
![ther, manual](assets/manual-bits/ther-m016.png)
ther, others, ard, toward  
R goes inside H.

THR, THER: T can be omitted.

See P for PH, PHTH and PTH. Sometimes the H turns in the opposite direction.

See SH and TH for those joins. Sometimes H is smaller or not completed.

**Supplement**

No notes on H, CH or WH. From the Specimen of the Ordinary Style, Abbreviated:

* Each, much, changes, which, change, such, characters, detached, teachers, school-masters  
* Why, who, when, which, somewhat, whatever, what, wholesale, 

NCH and SCH can be written without an angle or break – ie in the other direction, still below the line. (Supplement) 

* inch, such, school, much (Supplement)

TCH. The T may be omitted. (Supplement and Revised) (No examples.)

**Teaching**

H has its diminutive analogue in R, both lie at the top of a following line; CH and L are similar, and lie at the bottom of a line. WH is made like CH but not joined at the top. It may also be remembered thus, enlarge the W to look like H

* H, R, CH, L, who

**Revised**

CH is written three ways to facilitate joining. The first is used in compounds CHR and RCH. Some of these are above the line. (Revised, p4, Compound Characters)

(Astute readers will see significant differences in some words between Revised and the other sources.) 

* CH-1, CH-2, CH-3, Christ, arch, filch, chat, such, scholar, scheme, when (Revised)

CHL may be written in two ways. (Revised, p4, Compound Characters)

* CHL-1, CHL-2, chloric, richly, speechless (Revised)

In adding inflections to CH they may be joined either above or below. (Revised, p7, How to Write and Join the Characters)

* Aches, pitch'd, filches, pilchard (Revised)

WH

* Whose, when, chose, chin (Revised, p5, Compound Characters)

## I

All examples from the Manual are under Joining Vowels with Vowels.

xxx I is often started below the line in short words such as IN. This is not in any rules, but is demonstrated on the first page of the Preface to The New Testament (Stevens)

IC vs INC: This is often tricky, but fortunately the word is usually clear from context. If you need to make it clear, then do the following:

INC: Make sure you do not go down as I changes to C. The first part of the C retraces part of the I.

IN: Make sure that you do a full N. The first part of the C does not retrace any part of the N.

ING: 
![ing, manual](assets/manual-bits/ing-m016.png)
Manual: using, saying, seeming, king, sing, singing.  
```us(ing1), say(ing2), seem(ing2), king, sing, sing(ing2)```

This form is used only for the inflection "ing" and not in other words. It is better to curve the stroke after D,M,N,T,V and vowels. (Manual)

I vote we use it in sing and king. It's already used in thing and bring. (Cricket)

## J

Manual has no images.

B, G, J, K, L, P, QU and V can be omitted using modes.

## K

K has no images.

B, G, J, K, L, P, QU and V can be omitted using modes.

xxx

KS: S joined to the finish of F or K is better turned up rather than down. (Teaching1)

* Taken (Manual)  
* Looks, works, walks, like, beak, duke (Revised)



## L

![l, manual](assets/manual-bits/l-m009.png)
Manual: black, bread, clay, crow, addle, dry, flow, fro, glad, grade, play, pray, little, litre, slay, Israel, held, herd, world, already,  
lf, half, lk, walk, lp, help, lt, wilt, lv, salve

When standing by itself as an initial, L or R is prefixed by a short stroke showing its direction. In other cases the distinction is obvious.

The circle is so small that it can fit nicely inside T, for RT and TR. (Cricket)

Other shorthand systems (notably Gregg) base direction on the surrounding strokes. This can get confusing when switching systems. Each Orthic book has a mnemonic or two to help.

Sometimes the pen continues around the circle, retracing part of it, to reach the next letter. Sometimes it changes direction before the circle finishes. I have found no rules about this, other than SH/SHR, but several examples. (Cricket)

Examples:  
Manual: proof (Alphabet), present (P)
xxx Revised: waltz, zebra (Alphabet)

## M

![m, manual](assets/manual-bits/m-m009.png)
Manual: mp, imply, mb, limb, ms

Omit A and O before M and N. See General Rules.

See DEN for D, T, N, M blends.
xxx


MB can be written as a tall M. (Supplement, Revised p7 Other Slurs)

MBS, when preceded by E, I or U, the S turns up (as after F and K). (Revised, p7, Slurs

MM, MN can be written as one double-wide M. (Teaching)  
Note that omitting A and O before M and N means that MN can mean man or mon.
 
* Supplement: member, number, many, woman, human, money  
* Revised: MB, timber, lumber, lamb, temper, lumper, lamp – fix the order  
  Kembs, climbs, numbs

## N

![n, manual](assets/manual-bits/n-m009.png)
ng, singer, nsp, inspect, nc, since, nch, inches, nd, India, nf, infer, nj, injury, nl, unless, ns, sense, nt, sent, nk, sink, nqu, inquest, nv, invent

Omit A and O before M and N. See General Rules.

ING: See I. Only use the *ING* blend for verbs and *thing* compounds. That blend is described under Word Parts. I'm happy to use the ing form for other purposes, but am in the minority. (Cricket)



NSP: Omit S.

NG, NSP: No angle need be made in the compounds NG and NSP. (N followed by downstroke).

See DEN for D, T, N, M blends.


xxx
NCH and SCH may be written without an angle or break. (Supplement)  
(They are written in the opposite direction.)



NK has no angle (Revised)


* Supplement: inch, such, school  
* Revised: inspirit, inspect, ensphere, conspire, wink, rank, sink, tinker, ginger, hang, sting, singer  
  (Note that Revised uses a large H in SH.) inherit, inhale, enrich, enroll, inward, enwrap  


## O

All examples from the Manual are under Joining Vowels with Vowels.

Omit A and O before M and N. See General Rules.

xxx

OYS: Turn the S up, as for FS and KS (Revised)

Revised: cloys, employs, coat, cot




## P

![p, manual](assets/manual-bits/p-m010.png)
Manual: sp, sphere, ps, cusps, ph, phrase, phlegm, pl, place, pr, present, pd, depth, phth

B, G, J, K, L, P, QU and V can be omitted using modes.

PS, SP, SPS: S is more shallow and the angle is rounded.

PH: H might be on either side depending on following letter.

PHL, PHR: small circle goes inside the H.

PR: Exit off the top.

xxx
PW uses angle-W (Revised)

* Manual: PH-1, PH-2, phrase, phlegm, spear, cusps, place, present, depth, PHTH  
* Revised: PHL, PHR, PHTH, PW, speak, trips, cusps


The first (ccw, H to the right) is used in the compound PHR, before E U, and final. The second (cw, H to the left) is used in other cases. (Revised)
 
* Phar, phy (Teaching)  
* PH-1, Phrase, philter, sulphur, epitaph, PH-2, phase, phlegm, physic (Revised)



  


## Q

![q, manual](assets/manual-bits/q-m010.png)
Manual: esquire

B, G, J, K, L, P, QU and V can be omitted using modes.

All four books state that Q is always followed by U, and thus U can be omitted. This is outdated.

I suggest using the Q shape for QU. In the rare case where U should not be included, indicate this by a dash across the loop. This does not need to be done for initials, where only one letter is written. In the even rarer case where both letters are written in an initial, I recommend you revert to longhand for the first occurence. (Cricket)


## R

![r, manual](assets/manual-bits/r-m010.png)
Manual: fierce, rd, rt, rf, rk, work, rn, learn, rp, rs, rv

See L for details and contrasting examples.

RCE is written like lower-case E, according to the Manual. As near as I can tell, Callendar makes a slight angle at just before the R, so your pen goes to the right and the R is closer to being a circle. If you're happy making R a loop instead of a circle, this complexity can be avoided. (Cricket)


## S

![s, manual](assets/manual-bits/s-m011.png)
Manual: shed, Tisri, shred, school, sc, scent, sk, sl, slew, sm, sn, sp, sphere, squ, square, st, still, sw, answer

![s cap, manual](assets/manual-bits/s-cap-m011.png)
Manual: S.E.

S is vertical when written alone, to differentiate from E.

SCH: Contrast Manual vs Revised.

SH: H is smaller. Exit off the top to distinguish from SP.

SHR: R is inside H.

SP: Exit off the bottom to distinguish from SH.

SW: See W.


xxx someone, who?? described it as touch and reverse, spin around and continue



xxx


S: Nch, sch

These combinations may be written without an angle or break. (See *inch* ![][image70], *such* ![][image71], *school* ![][image72], in the list.)


R: in AYS and OYS (in that order, not YAS or YOA) S goes up to the left.

T: **S after F or K**

*S* joined to the finish of *F* or *K* is better, (as the hand is traveling in a curve), turned *up* rather than down; thus ![][image73] *ks* is better than ![][image74].

R : S after AY, OY

T: **S before and after P**

*S* before and after *P* should be rounded. ![][image1] *sp*, ![][image2] *ps*, ![][image3] *sps*.

The angular form is used after *S*, thus ![][image75] *sw*, formed of ![][image76] *s* and ![][image77] *w*.

..

The only other cases of sub-linear writing up to this point are the words ‘take' and ‘sake' and their inflections, which are written ![\`t\_\*\`, \`t\_Y\`, \`s\_\*\`][image78], etc. The *k* throwing *below* the line, but in no other case is the *k* so treated.




## T

![t, manual](assets/manual-bits/t-m011.png)
with, both, tch, sketch, tle, turtle, tr, truth, tw, two

![th initial, manual](assets/manual-bits/th-raised-m015.png)
the, they, this, them, tho', that

![ther, manual](assets/manual-bits/ther-m016.png)
ther, others, ard, toward

TH-final: Don't close the H.

R goes inside H.

THER: H with R inside. Omit the T. (Same as HR.)

Initial TH is omitted in all common words. The omission is shown by writing the rest of the word above the line, Mode 1. 

xxx Use this *only when initial*, except in the case of the word *although*.


xxxxx


Slurs mm/mn, dd, dt, and td

Again, *mm* or *mn* often come together when by the rule the vowel is left out, as in the word *man*, ![][image109], now one large curve will embrace both ![][image110].

Similarly *dd*, *dt*, or *td* may be represented by a large ![][image111].

T slur rule for count, country, duty

We have seen that as ![][image112] \= *count*, therefore ![][image113] \= *county*, we therefore extract a rule *t* may be slurred in such words as *duty*, *bounty*, etc.

## U

All examples from the Manual are under Joining Vowels with Vowels.

see E, Joining Vowels, for E vs U

## V

![v, manual](assets/manual-bits/v-m012.png)
Manual: minster (not minister), Minver, stew, view

V is distinguished from  ste by its size; cp.

B, G, J, K, L, P, QU and V can be omitted using modes.

See Word Parts for initial EV.

## W 

![w, manual](assets/manual-bits/w1-m012.png)
Manual: way, woe, wet, write

![w, manual](assets/manual-bits/w2-m012.png)
Manual: sews, cows, laws, wk, hawk, wl, owls, wn, dawn

W goes upwards. C and F go downwards.

Use left-W at the beginning of a word, except before R. It can start at the 3:00 position, to form 3/4 of a circle, for ease of writing.

Use right-W at the end of most words. (Again, there is an exception.)

Change the exit angle of W to blend with the following letter.

WR: Distinguished from TH by its size.
WH: See H.
WS final: The addition of S forms a loop.
WK, WL, WN: Notice how the letters blend.




xxx


Another way to remember *W* is to point out that whether initial or final, *it is an upward tick*, as ![][image157] *wo*, ![][image158] *ow*. The letter may be written either circularly or angularly as ![][image159] or ![][image160] *owing*, ![][image161] or ![][image162].

The angular form is used after *S*, thus ![][image163] *sw*, formed of ![][image164] *s* and ![][image165] *w*. To add *S* to final *W*, elongate the loop, thus ![][image166] *cow*, ![][image167] *cows*.

## X

![x, manual](assets/manual-bits/x-m012.png)
Manual: xh, xp, xt, extent, exhort, expense

There is no need to make an angle in the combinations *Exh*, *Exch*. (Manual)

EX: As there is no English word beginning with *X* that is not preceded by *E*, this character may be used to represent *Ex*. (Manual)

*X* is made up, as in longhand, of *C* and *S*. You can often omit the S, or merge the S with the following letter. (Cricket)

## Y
![y, manual](assets/manual-bits/y-m012-y.png)
Manual: yacht, yet, yore yule

![y unaltered, manual](assets/manual-bits/y-unaltered-015.png)
Manual: applied, tries, easiest, happiest, ```aplyd, trys, easyst, hapyr```

Let Y stand unaltered. In adding inflections to words ending in y, the y is not changed to i or ie.

## Z
![z, manual](assets/manual-bits/z-012.png)
Manual: daze, Fitz, puzzle

# PREVIOUS METHOD




## A {#a-2}

S: **Acqu**

Written *aqu* ![][image192].

Adj

Written *aj* ![][image193].

Adv

Slurred into one large character compounded of *d* and *v* [as explained in the *Manual,* ‘Hints for Reporting,' ‘Slurring.'](https://orthic.shorthand.fun/manual#slurring) \[E.g., ![][image194] *advantage.*\]

S: Ge, ‑dge, ‑age

These and derived terminations are similarly expressed by a dot below and to the right to indicate the *g.* ([Mode (3), *Manual,* ‘Hints.'](https://orthic.shorthand.fun/manual#modes) See also *knowledge* ![][image195], *agent* ![][image196], etc. in the list.)

T: **\-ation**

is a common ending, and it is wise to shorten it as much as possible, therefore use detached *n* ![][image197] to represent this termination, as ![][image198].

T: Sub linear writing is writing *below* the line. We have already had an example of this, with the reason, in ![][image199] \= *ight*. From this we can easily draw another rule \- in the combination *dge*, *age*, *gn*, or *gram* it is clear that equally as in the case of "ight", the *g*, as part of the termination or syllable, throws the rest of the word *below* the line, e.g. ![][image200] \= *for gn* \= *foreign*, ![][image201] *age*, ![][image202] *magnify*, etc.

## B {#b-1}

S: (16) The use of modes (1) and (3) (except in the special cases (17) already given) should be almost entirely restricted to the expression of *V* and *G* respectively. (18) Many students appear to have misunderstood the principles of their application and some have even (19) gone so far as to write all words beginning with *p, b* or *v* above the line omitting (page 2, line 1\) the initial letter. This is manifestly absurd. The initial letter of a word is (2) usually the most important for its identification and should therefore be retained — except in (3) one special case namely that of a com(mo)n prefix. Such-a prefix being common to a large class (4) of words is a less use for purpose of identification and may therefore be (5) suitably expressed by the method of supra-linear writing.

S:

Be

This prefix is peculiar to a special class of English words, and may also be expressed by writing above the line.

The word *be* is expressed by a dot above the line ![][image203]; *been* and *being* by *n* ![][image204] and straight *‑ing* ![][image205]; the former will not be found to clash with *than.*

T: **Be**

As there is a very close relation between *V* and *B*, and as words with the prefix "be" belong to a special English class, we may without fear use *Mode 1* to indicate the *prefix* "Be". This abbreviation is only to be used when "be" is a distinct prefix, as ![][image206] \= *behold*; it would be incorrect to write ![][image207] for *bead*, this would be *Be-ad*, not *bead*. By the same reasoning as the *dot* indicating *vowel-v-vowel* so the verb "be" may be shown by a dot; thus ![][image208]; the only liberty taken in using this prefix "be" is in the common words *been*, *better*, *best*, and *by* which are written ![][image209], respectively.

![][image210] \= *bring*, compare crooked *ing* ![][image211] for *thing*.

## C {#c-1}

S: **Com, con**

Expressed by a dot on the line written close in front of the word, as explained in the *Manual,* ‘Hints for Reporting.' \[Jeremy: As far as I can tell, this is not actually explained there. You could infer it, but it's not explained.\] \[E.g. ![][image212] *common,* ![][image213] *conc(ern)ing.*\] In taking notes, the dot may generally be omitted or expressed by Mode (2). In correspondence it should be retained.

In compound prefixes, such as *incom-, discom-,* etc., the *com-* or *con-* is expressed by Mode (2).

Circum

Written *cir* ![][image214] followed by a short break to represent *cum.* *Circe* ![][image215] is the the regular longhand abbreviation for the word *circumstance.*

T: 

The common primitive *con* or *com* may be expressed by a *dot* *on* the line, or by leaving it out altogether, and writing the rest of the word quite close to the preceeding word, as ![][image216], ![][image217], or ![][image218] \= *I commend*.

## D {#d-1}

S: Ge, ‑dge, ‑age

These and derived terminations are similarly expressed by a dot below and to the right to indicate the *g.* ([Mode (3), *Manual,* ‘Hints.'](https://orthic.shorthand.fun/manual#modes) See also *knowledge* ![][image195], *agent* ![][image196], etc. in the list.)

T: Sub linear writing is writing *below* the line. We have already had an example of this, with the reason, in ![][image199] \= *ight*. From this we can easily draw another rule \- in the combination *dge*, *age*, *gn*, or *gram* it is clear that equally as in the case of "ight", the *g*, as part of the termination or syllable, throws the rest of the word *below* the line, e.g. ![][image200] \= *for gn* \= *foreign*, ![][image201] *age*, ![][image202] *magnify*, etc.

T ![][image219] for *dv*.

Slurs mm/mn, dd, dt, and td

Again, *mm* or *mn* often come together when by the rule the vowel is left out, as in the word *man*, ![][image220], now one large curve will embrace both ![][image221].

Similarly *dd*, *dt*, or *td* may be represented by a large ![][image222].

## E {#e-2}



s:

* *every* ![][image226]  
* *evening* ![][image227]  
* *event* ![][image228]  
* *evident* ![][image229]  
* *evil* ![][image230]

and their derivatives are abbreviated by the *V*\-Mode, in the same way as *ever,* by omitting the *eve* and writing the rest of the word above the line.

**Exception:** *Even* is written *e'en* ![][image231], to distinguish it from *than* or *then.*

\++++

S: 

\-ent	.t

\-ence	.ce

\-ency	.cy

T: 

* *X* is made up, as in longhand, of *C* and *S*, ![][image232], and there is no English word beginning with *X* that is not preceded by *E*, this character may be used to represent *Ex*. There is no need to make an angle in the combinations *Exh*, *Exch*, as ![][image233].  
* Ever  
* Draw attention to ![][image234] \= *ever* : this appears an arbitrary; it is not; students will see the logic at the next lesson.

## F {#f-1}


## G {#g-1}



S: \-graph \-\> .ph

S: Ge, ‑dge, ‑age

These and derived terminations are similarly expressed by a dot below and to the right to indicate the *g.* ([Mode (3), *Manual,* ‘Hints.'](https://orthic.shorthand.fun/manual#modes) See also *knowledge* ![][image195], *agent* ![][image196], etc. in the list.)

Gn, gram

Indicated by *n* ![][image238] and *m* ![][image239] respectively written below (Mode (3)) to indicate the *g,* as in the termination *‑ight.* (See *foreign* ![][image240], *sign* ![][image241], in the list.)

T: Sub linear writing is writing *below* the line. We have already had an example of this, with the reason, in ![][image199] \= *ight*. From this we can easily draw another rule \- in the combination *dge*, *age*, *gn*, or *gram* it is clear that equally as in the case of "ight", the *g*, as part of the termination or syllable, throws the rest of the word *below* the line, e.g. ![][image200] \= *for gn* \= *foreign*, ![][image201] *age*, ![][image202] *magnify*, etc.

## H {#h}



## I {#i-2}





??? \-ation

is a common ending, and it is wise to shorten it as much as possible, therefore use detached *n* ![][image261] to represent this termination, as ![][image262].


S: \-ism  .m

## J {#j-1}

## K {#k}

## L {#l-1}


T; **L slurred with T in wealth, health**

*L* may be slurred with the *t* in such words as *wealth*, *health*, etc., and the softly sounding vowel in terminations such as "al", *final* ![][image263], "er" in *upper* ![][image264], etc.

pl, pr, fl, fr, ml, mr

## M {#m-1}


## NESS

S: Ness

This termination should be written *‑ess* detached, by the general rule, and not *ns* as given in the *Manual.* \[E.g. ![][image275] *goodness.*\] Detached *n* and *ns* can then be used, as in longhand, for the expression of the common terminations *‑ation* and *‑ations.*

T: **\-ness**

*es*, ![][image276].

## O {#o-2}


T: ou for ound or ount

Show the importance of ![][image280] *ou* standing for *ound* or *ount*. Emphasize this by such words as

ou for ound or ount

**Show the importance of ![][image281] *ou* standing for *ound* or *ount*. Emphasize this by such words as**

* **![][image282] *pound*,**  
* **![][image283] *sound*,**  
* **![][image284] *count*; hence**  
  * **![][image285] *counter*,**  
  * **![][image286] *county*,**  
  * **![][image287] *country*.**

## P {#p-1}

S: \-ship .p

T: **Per pre pri pro and peri para**

As stated, supra linear writing is very useful for rapidity, and if other prefixes can be found that cannot possibly clash with the rules laid down, they may with advantage be safely indicated by this mode. Such are found in words derived from the Latin and Greek languages. We thus get the prefixes *per*, *pre*, *pri*, and *pro* from the Latin, and *peri* and *para* from the Greek; all of which may be expressed by *Mode 1*.

\+++

S:

Per-, pro-, pre-

These prefixes, being Latin, will not clash with any of the above English prefixes, and may be expressed in the same way with great saving of time and space. \[E.g. ![][image288] *person,* ![][image289] *present*, ![][image290] *promise.*\]

*Pre-* and *pro-* are distinguished from *per,* if necessary, by retaining the vowels *e* and *o.* The cases, however, in which it is necessary to make the distinction are very rare.

When any of these prefixes occur in the middle of a word after another prefix, as in the words *unbelief, compromise,* etc., they are expressed by Mode (1), that is to say by writing the terminal portion of the word close above and to the right of the initial prefix. \[E.g. ![][image291] *comprehend.*\] In the prefixes *super, supra, hyper,* the *per* is similarly expressed.

The allied prefix *pri* may be expressed in the same way as *pre* in some common words. \[E.g., ![][image292] *private*.\]

Para, peri

These Greek prefixes may also be expressed by supra-linear writing for the same reason. *Peri* is distinguished by retaining the *i*; it may be regarded as a special case of *per.*

*Examples* of these prefixes will be found in the list of [‘Examples of Abbreviations.'](https://orthic.shorthand.fun/supplement#examples-of-abbreviations)

\+++

## Q {#q-1}

## R {#r-1}

## S {#s-1}

## T {#t-1}

S:

Tch

The *t* may always be omitted in this combination. \[Jeremy: As far as I can tell, not a single example of this rule appears in this book\!\]

?? manual says omit 

Trans

Written *trs,* as in longhand. \[E.g. ![][image293] *transact.*\]

## U {#u-2}

## V {#v-1}

s:

* ***every*** **![][image294]**  
* ***evening*** **![][image295]**  
* ***event*** **![][image296]**  
* ***evident*** **![][image297]**  
* ***evil*** **![][image298]**

**and their derivatives are abbreviated by the *V*\-Mode, in the same way as *ever,* by omitting the *eve* and writing the rest of the word above the line.**

**Exception: *Even* is written *e'en* ![][image299], to distinguish it from *than* or *then.***

Ness

**This termination should be written *‑ess* detached, by the general rule, and not *ns* as given in the *Manual.* \[E.g. ![][image300] *goodness.*\] Detached *n* and *ns* can then be used, as in longhand, for the expression of the common terminations *‑ation* and *‑ations.***



Ve, ‑ive

**This common termination is expressed by a dot above and to the right of the word to indicate the *v.* ([Mode (1), *Manual,* ‘Hints.'](https://orthic.shorthand.fun/manual#modes)) \[E.g. ![][image301] *arrive.*\] When the word is inflected the last letter of the inflection is substituted for the dot. (See *gives* ![][image302], *given* ![][image303], *selves* ![][image304], etc. in the list.)**

T:

Eve (vowel V vowel)

It is clear that the shorthand characters *eve* ![][image305] must throw everything following the final *e* above the line, and it is also evident that such words cannot clash with that peculiarity of the English language *Th*, except in the words *even* and *then*, which has been provided for above.

Therefore apply the rule *Mode 1*, and *wherever* *vowel v vowel* come, *in any part of a word*, leave them out, and write the rest of the word *above* the line, just where it would have come had the whole word been written. E.g. ![][image306] \= ![][image307] *given*, ![][image308] *loved*. N.B. It is better to write the vowel after *l* and *r* for reasons similar to those given in Lesson 4, to show the direction in which the consonants are turned. ![][image309] \= *evident*, ![][image310] \= *conceived*, ![][image311] \= *ever*. See paragraph 2, Lesson 4\.

But how about a word ending in *ave*, *ove*, etc. only? What is Euclid's definition of the end of straight lines? A point, is it not? Shorthand *e* ![][image312] is a straight line; the end of that straight line ![][image313] is a point; therefore write the point. Thus ![][image314] *give*, ![][image315] *love*, ![][image316] *rove*.

# General Method of Abbreviation and  Abbreviations for Common Words {#general-method-of-abbreviation-and-abbreviations-for-common-words}

The general method of abbreviating long words is to write only the first syllable, and, if necessary, to indicate the termination by writing the last letter or two, separated by a small interval from the first part; thus,


![alt text](assets/manual-bits/gen-abbr-m017.png)

# CONSIDER DOING

Find examples of the modes from manual
MODES. If the larger signs are omitted in abbreviating, their omission should (10) be indicated by mode, that is by bringing the outline and writing the termination close (11) to the first part of-the word.

The omission of B P or V is indicated by (12) mode I, that is by writing the termination above; thus

whichr = whichever,
gn = given.
(13) The omission of G K J or QU is shown by writing the termination below, called (14) mode III; thus

sn = sign,
st = sight,
tn = taken,
wa. = wage,
was = wages
(15) The omission of other characters and syllables may be shown by mode II, that is by (16) writing the termination on the same level; thus

dif-ce = difference,
a-plish = accomplish.
(17) Some common words and prefixes, especially b and con or com, may (18) also be expressed by modes, but this method must be applied with caution; –

(19) un-n = uncommon,
i-c. = i-c(o)nceive,
isha. = ishabe (i shall be),
chasn = (whi)ch has b(ee)n,
(20) yd = bey(on)d,
f = before,
ter = better,
nlnt = benevolent,
fry = for every.
