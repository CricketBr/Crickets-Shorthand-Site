Keep it short for this, just the Orthic spelling and refer to Consolidated Reference.

Maybe a table? beginning, middle, end?

table of mode ?

Or just list the letters, and subheading under each for mode, prefix, etc

Last idea probably best.


Orthic letters
- prefix
  - no gap
  - mode 1
  - mode 2
  - mode 3
- middle
  - no gap
  - mode 1
  - mode 2
  - mode 3
- suffix
  - no gap
  - mode 1
  - mode 2
  - mode 3


Each entry would be a link to the big reference page. Probably not a live link at first. So many anchors to add to each heading!
I want to manually do the links in each heading, I think, so V in joins and V in abbreviating aren't just V1 and V2.
