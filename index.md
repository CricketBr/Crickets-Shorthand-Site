# Still Under Construction

## [css Testing (Part of Construction)](css-test.md)

Nothing to see.

## Still Under Construction


Finally! All in one place and with human-readable URLs.

Still a work in progress. Plans will probably change.

You can reach me at:
* cricket@onebit.ca
* Discord International Shorthand Society @cricket
* Reddit u/CrBr
* GitHub @CricketBr
* [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/CricketBr/Crickets-Shorthand-Site/issues)

Comments and corrections are more than welcome.

## [Cricket's Shorthand Tips](cr-shorthand-tips.md)

A collection of tips I've accumulated over the years. Replaced by Cricket's Shorthand Course.

## [Cricket's Shorthand Course](cr-shorthand-course.md)

A series of steps for learning shorthand, especially if you don't have a teacher to guide you.

## Cricket's Shorthand Course Summary -- Not Started

Because the first one, with all the reasons and references, is too long.

## [Orthic Consolidated Reference  -- In Progress](orth-cnsl-ref.md)

*Being an Improved and Expanded Consolidation of Various Books with Clarifications, Additions, Warnings and Opinions of the Author and Others who Might Comment*

An attempt to organize the all the Orthic rules into a single document for reference. The four Orthic books were written by three different authors on two continents. Instead of issuing a revised manual, books 2 and 3 (Supplement and Teaching) only show changes to the system. They move rules around, add some, and change others. The 4th (Revised) is the complete system but has some significant differences.

This book combines all the rules from all the earlier books, except some that are only in the Reporting Style. It is *not* intended as an introduction to Orthic. The Manual or Revised is best for that. (I recommend the Manual, and anything Revised does differently just feels wrong to anyone who started with the Manual.)

Hopefully it creates more clarity than confusion.

## Orthic Consolidated Study Lists -- Not Started

Lists of words by rule, created as Cricket needs them.

## [Orthic Consolidated -- Words from Examples](orth-cnsl-words-examples.md)

## [Orthic Consolidated -- Words from Passages](orth-cnsl-words-passages.md)

All the words used as examples and in longer passages, up to but only sometimes including Reporting. Includes Aesops and Dufferin's Speech, but not Psalms or New Testament.

## Orthic Consolidated Reverse Rules -- Not Started

Rules sorted by Orthic spelling.

## The Hobbit Learns Orthic -- Not started

A set of lessons based on Tolkein's The Hobbit, progressing from Fully Written to Supplement/Correspondence Style. The order of presentation will be "as needed." In theory that will cover most of the useful rules at a reasonable pace.

## [The Orthic Hobbit -- Barely started](orth-hobbit.md)

A crowd-sourced version of The Hobbit, written in whatever styles the contributors prefer. (Contributions welcome!)

## Licencing

Unless otherwise stated, all my work is licenced under ...
``` probably creative commons share alike ```
