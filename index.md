Still a work in progress. Plans will probably change.

Comments and corrections are more than welcome.

## Details

## Cricket's Shorthand Course

### [Course](cr-shorthand-course.md)

A series of steps for learning shorthand, especially if you don't have a teacher to guide you.

### Course Summary -- Not Started

Because the first one, with all the reasons and references, is too long.

### [Tips - Deprecated](cr-shorthand-tips.md)

A collection of tips I've accumulated over the years. Replaced by Cricket's Shorthand Course.

## Orthic Consolidated

### [Reference  -- Final Edit Stage](orth-cnsl-ref.md)

*Being an Improved and Expanded Consolidation of Various Books with Clarifications, Additions, Warnings and Opinions of the Author and Others who Might Comment*

The four Orthic books were written by three different authors on two continents. Instead of issuing a revised manual, books 2 and 3 (Supplement and Teaching) only show changes to the system. They move rules around, add some, and change others. The 4th (Revised), written many years later, is the complete system but has some significant differences.

This page combines all the rules from all the books, except Reporting Style. It is *not* intended as an introduction to Orthic. The Manual or Revised is best for that. (I recommend the Manual. Anything Revised does differently just feels wrong to anyone who started with the Manual.) (Some of the more useful Reporting rules are included.)

Hopefully it creates more clarity than confusion.

### Study Lists -- Not Started

Lists of words by rule, created as Cricket needs them.

### [Words from Examples](orth-cnsl-words-examples.md)

### [Words from Passages](orth-cnsl-words-passages.md)

All the words used as examples and in longer passages, up to but only sometimes including Reporting. Includes Aesops and Dufferin's Speech, but not Psalms or New Testament.

### Orthic Consolidated Reverse Rules -- Not Started

Rules sorted by Orthic spelling.
