# Introduction to Orthic Consolidated

Orthic shorthand is a good first shorthand for most students. It is quick to learn at the Fully Written Level, and multiple levels can be used in a single sentence without confusion. Based on stroke counts, its speed potential is comparable to other office and personal use shorthands. The Abbreviated and Reporting levels are even faster.

In keeping with tradition, this book begins with a list of the deficiencies of previous books:
- Rules are spread out over too many publications.
- Minimal guidance for studying and goals.
- Insufficient and incomplete practice material at each chapter. Some rules may not appear in the passages chosen.

Callendar wrote the Manual in 1891, then, instead of updating it, he issued the Supplement in 1982. This booklet moved some rules from advanced to intermediate, and changed a few. Stevens wrote The Teaching of Orthic Shorthand in 1896, and, again, instead for writing complete book, he told the readers to refer to the previous publications. He also moved rules between levels, added some, and, I suspect, changed a few. Finally, in 1911, Clarey wrote Orthic Shorthand: Revised, Extended and Improved. That book brought together all the rules, changed a few, and removed the distinct levels. (See below for full titles and links to the books.)

This book addresses the first deficiency, hopefully without creating too much more confusion. It assumes you have read the Manual or Revised.

[Cricket's Shorthand Course](cr-shorthand-course.md) will help with the second.

When cropping images, I usually chose just the rows showing the Orthic outline. There are usually enough longhand words in the image that you can use your browser's Search feature to find the rule in the text.

Image file names are of the format concept-book-page.ftype, where page is the page of the original scanned document.

The Supplement does not have images for all concepts, often referring to the large plate in the Manual for the Reporting level. Teaching sometimes improves on that. In these cases, I have only used images from Teaching.

Teaching also has good examples of the ambguity some of the more complicated rules are intended to prevent.

Revised? It's mixed bag. It's clearly written, but some of the changes to allow more speed conflict with the earlier books and result in rules that are harder to explain. Some of its rules are only needed to accomodate Clarey's loopier style of writing. Sometimes, though, its explanations are better.

"No examples" means no example in the instructions. If you find examples in other material, please let me know.
