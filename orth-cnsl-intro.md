# Introduction to Orthic Consolidated

Orthic shorthand is a good first shorthand for most students. It is quick to learn at the Fully Written Level, and multiple levels can be used in a single sentence without confusion. Based on stroke counts, its speed potential is comparable to other office and personal use shorthands. The Abbreviated and Reporting levels are even faster.

In keeping with tradition, this book begins with a list of the deficiencies of previous books:
- Rules are spread out over too many publications.
- Minimal guidance for studying and goals.
- Insufficient and incomplete practice material at each chapter. Some rules may not appear in the passages chosen.

Callendar wrote the Manual in 1891, then, instead of updating it, he issued the Supplement in 1982. This booklet moved some rules from advanced to intermediate, and changed a few. Stevens wrote The Teaching of Orthic Shorthand in 1896, and, again, instead for writing complete book, he told the readers to refer to the previous publications. He also moved rules between levels, added some, and, I suspect, changed a few. Finally, in 1911, Clarey wrote Orthic Shorthand: Revised, Extended and Improved. That book brought together all the rules, changed a few, and removed the distinct levels. (See below for full titles and links to the books.)

This book addresses the first deficiency, hopefully without creating too much more confusion.

[Cricket's Shorthand Course](cr-shorthand-course.md) will help with the second.

Some of Clarey's explanations and examples are good. Some of his additions and changes are not. His penmanship style is very different, and worth experimenting with.

Includes a notation that will encode Orthic text into ASCII.   Contains all the example words from the Manual and the Supplement, and several examples from writing specimens in the Manual.
