All Comments Welcome.

My intention is to begin by assuming you can read the Fully Written Style, and add one or two new rules every few lines. I will prioritize rules that I find the most useful. I might introduce them more frequently to save what's left of my sanity.

I'll also be speedbuilding each passage, so might also share that version.
