My intention is to begin by assuming you can read the Fully Written Style, and add a new rule every few lines. I will prioritize rules that I find the most useful, but and introduce them more frequently to save what's left of my sanity.

I'll also be speedbuilding each passage, so might also share that version.

It's a plan. In pencil.

All Comments Welcome.
