## Introduction

If a roll doesn't make sense, re-roll it. Adding all the questions to prevent nonsensical choices made the chart too big.

This is for the 30 minutes out of each hour that you practice dictation.

If an experiment shows you can almost meet the challenge, then repeat the experiment once or twice to see if you should increase the number permanently. If it shows otherwise, then do not repeat that experiment for a few passages.

## First Few Dictations

Read the shorthand first.

> How long a dictation? For the first few days the dictation may profitably be limited to 30-second readings. After a few days two 30-second readings may be combined into a 60-second reading. From that time on, in general, 60-second readings seem the optimum length, with an occasional 30-second reading to enable the learner to write at a higher rate than he can get on the 60-second readings and with an occasional reading of 2, 3, 4, or 5 minutes. (Leslie, Methods, p169)

First Dictation:
* 30s at 20wpm = 10 words length.
* Pratt's Easy Intro to Dictation, without sound file.
* Pratt's Easy Intro to Dictation, with sound file.
* Repeat until reach 40wpm or higher.

Pause after every few takes to practice difficult words. At this stage, writing rapidly is more important than writing perfectly.

Next Several:
* As for First Dictation, but increase length by 10 words for each passage.

Alternate Method:

* As for First Dictation, but repeat each 30s passage until you can write it at 50wpm.
* Combine two 30s passages into one 60s passage. Drop speed to 40wpm to compensate for new length.

## Routine Speed Building
Start this when you can write practiced material at 40wpm for 1 minute, without breaking it into parts first.

### Length

Leave length and endurance training until after finishing theory, unless your book has a variety of lengths in each chapter. Be aware that you may need to reduce speed for longer passages.

First few dictations: See above to reach 1-minute.

Use 1-minute dictations for most of your practice until you finish the theory. Total time to reach the speed and duration goals seems to be the same, regardless of how you organize it. Leaving duration training until later is less confusing.

**To Increase Length**

* 1-minute as usual
* 1-minute
* If final speed for 1-minute is =>50wpm, then combine previous two passages into one 2-minute passage. Take 10wpm slower than 1-minute speed.

If your book gradually increases dic



Each time you finish four 1-minute passages, combine them into two 2-minute and then one 4-minute passages. Drop starting and slowest speeds by 10wpm each time you double the length.

Skip if any length would be <40wpm.

When your 1-minute and 2-minute starting speeds are 

When your starting and final speed for a length are the same:
* Continue to use 1-minute for half the passages. This is where you build speed.
* Increase the other half by 30-60s. Stay at this length until 

### First reading, rotate through:

1. Well-written shorthand.
1. Other writers' shorthand.
1. Typed material.
1. Your own shorthand, eg one-try that has already been transcribed.

### Exercise, rotate through:

1. One-try

    Start when you can write from text with 95% accuracy (19/20)

    Prepare by:
    1. Read the text and practice new words.
    1. No preparation.

    Speed:
    1. Same as last time.
    1. Same as last time.
    1. Same as last time.
    1. Same as last time.
    1. Experiment increase by 5wpm.
    1. Experiment increase by 10wpm.

1. Pratt's Easy Intro to Dictation

    Preparation included in the method.

    More useful when starting dictation or for warmups. Also useful when a section is more difficult than the rest of a passage. Try this in the middle of other exercises if it might help.

1. Leslie's One Minute Speed Forcing Plan (slow, +, ++, very fast medium)

    Prepare by:
    1. Copying several times.
    1. Copying only once.
    1. Writing only new words.
    1. No preparation.
