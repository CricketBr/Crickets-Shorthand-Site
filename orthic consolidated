#Introduction

Orthic shorthand is a good first shorthand for most students. It is very quick to learn at the Fully Written Level, and multiple levels can be used in a single sentence without confusion.

The Fully Written level simply replaces each letter with a single-stroke equivalent, and provides “joins” for shapes that do not work well together. You do not need to relearn how to spell, or guess at letters that were left out. It reduces stroke count down to ??? compared to longhand cursive, which increases writing speed by ??? . This math says that speeds of 60 or higher are possible – but speedbuilding with this set of rules is not advised.

Excessive practice at the Fully Written level will train your hand and brain to write fully – even when it’s not necessary. Do the exercises as described, so you are 80% comfortable with the alphabet (even if you have to look up letters and combinations), then move to Abbreviated.

The Abbreviated level simplifies spelling and adds optional (but highly recommended) rules for abbreviations and endings. At first there were very few rules, but later publications added more. The rules are standardized so that it can be used in correspondence. Note: Orthic does not distinguish between shortened words, prefixes, and suffixes. They are all called abbreviations. The author of The Teaching of Orthic Shorthand claims you can reach 60wpm after finishing the 9 week program (and doing a mere 15 minutes a day of homework).

The final level, Reporting, began as a collection of optional ideas, often imported from other systems. No two writers at this level wrote the same. Some of these ideas were promoted to the Abbreviated level. In Teaching, the author says that Reporting is simply an extension of the Abbreviations already learned.

The existing publications have a few deficiencies:
- Rules are spread out over too many publications.
- Minimal guidance for studying.
- Insufficient material at each chapter. Some rules may not appear in the passages chosen.

This guide addresses the first problem. [Cricket’s Shorthand Tips](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zUC87XQtrLZB-0UZuWFSu_Sjv29id98xBRUQH7nsmrw/edit?usp=sharing) addresses the second, somewhat. The third, however, requires more work than any are willing to do. Once you've practiced the rules, the exercises from other shorthand books 

Speeds
Before computers, most adults could write cursive at 20-40 wpm (words per minute). An introductory typing class, with 110 hours in class, required 20wpm to pass. Typical speeds are now 20-80wpm. Entry level office shorthand in the US required 60 or 80wpm. Journalists in the UK needed 100wpm until fairly recently, and often considered shorthand their most difficult course. Current office shorthand requirement in other areas is 100-120. Toastmasters recommends 120 for formal speeches. Court reporting and closed captioning require over 200wpm, usually in bursts.
Publications and Source Material
Most are available on orthic.shorthand.fun .
Cursive, sometimes called Phonetic Cursive
A Manual of Cursive Shorthand, by Hugh L Callendar, 1889.
https://archive.org/details/manualofcursives00calliala/manualofcursives00calliala/page/n5/mode/2up
This is included for historical reasons only. It was Callendar’s first shorthand publication.
The Manual
A Manual of Orthographic Shorthand: The Cambridge System, by Hugh L Callendar, 1891.
https://orthic.shorthand.fun/manual#introductory-remarks
“Two and a half years’ experience in teaching Cursive has convinced me that the difficulties which beginners find in learning to spell correctly by sound are much greater than I had previously imagined; and that it is unadvisable to attempt to introduce a phonetic system of shorthand at an early stage in education.”
The Supplement
Supplement to the Manual of Orthic Shorthand [Orthographic Cursive], Hugh L Callendar, 1982
https://orthic.shorthand.fun/supplement
“It is now nearly a year since the publication of Orthographic Cursive. The approval with which it has been greeted on all sides has more than fulfilled the author’s expectations, and repaid him for the years which he has spent in the endeavour to devise a system of shorthand sufficiently simple for general use.”
…
“The object of the following pages is to supply fuller explanation and illustration of the methods of abbreviation given in the Manual as ‘Hints for the Reporting Style’ and to provide advanced writers of the system with additional matter for exercise and reading practice.”
Teaching (Parts 1 and 2)
The Teaching of Orthic Shorthand: A series of lessons for the use of teachers and students of Orthographic shorthand (Callendar's system), W Stevens, 1896
https://orthic.shorthand.fun/teaching-pt1
‘’The following lessons have been drawn up for the use of teachers in the “Orthic” system of shorthand.”
…
“If teachers and students will only follow these hints, and the lessons, as they are laid down, not hurrying, immediate success will accrue to their efforts.”
Part 1 covers the Manual in 9 lessons, and has links to practice material, and a few optional rules that are in neither the Manual nor the Supplement. Part 2 adds even more rules
Both the Manual and the Supplement ?? are needed to follow the lessons.

Notes on the Reporting Style

“At the request of a couple users here, I've put together some notes on W. Stevens's The Teaching of Orthic Shorthand.”
…
“Stevens occasionally overdoes things. There is a great deal to admire here, but there are many rough edges as well, and you should expect to do some fine-tuning if you want to use Orthic in a reporting style. All rules should be taken as suggestions. I will recommend against a couple of them along the way, though you may of course disagree with me.”


Penmanship










Unlike some shorthands, it is explicitly designed so you can mix levels in a single sentence, without confusion.


Orthic shorthand, invented by Hugh L Callendar, got shortchanged due to history. By the time it was invented, Pitman had cornered the market.
It’s very fast to learn at the Fully Written level, which reduces stroke count to ⅓  compared to longhand cursive (increase writing speed by 3). Higher levels have been reported to reach as high as 165 and 190wpm. (For comparison, 100wpm is suitable for offices. Toastmasters recommends 120wpm for formal speeches. Court reporters and closed captioners require over 200wpm, usually in bursts.
It is difficult to learn from the original books partly because of the way they are organized. The first one, the Manual, was printed in 1891. A year later Calendar published the Supplement, which improved the system. In order to learn it, though, you need to have both books open, reading the Manual, and then flipping through the Supplement to see if anything changed. Xx Stevens wrote a few samples (Aesop’s Fables and some Psalms). 




 has the potential to be as fast and clear – or clearer – than Gregg and Pitman.

I think myself that I could keep out of bed all right if I once got out. It is the wrenching away of the head from the pillow that I find so hard, and no amount of over-night determination makes it easier. I say to myself, after having wasted the whole evening, “Well, I won’t do any more work to-night; I’ll get up early to-morrow morning;” and I am thoroughly resolved to do so—then. In the morning, however, I feel less enthusiastic about the idea, and reflect that it would have been much better if I had stopped up last night. And then there is the trouble of dressing, and the more one thinks about that the more one wants to put it off.
