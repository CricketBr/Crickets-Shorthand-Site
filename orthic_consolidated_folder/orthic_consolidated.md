# Introduction to Orthic Consolidated

Orthic shorthand is a good first shorthand for most students. It is quick to learn at the Fully Written Level, and multiple levels can be used in a single sentence without confusion. Based on stroke counts, its speed potential is comparable to other office and personal use shorthands. The Abbreviated and Reporting levels are even faster.

In keeping with tradition, this book begins with a list of the deficiencies of previous books.
- Rules are spread out over too many publications. Instead of printing a revised Manual, they printed a Supplement and a Teaching booklet (with a few more abbreviations). Then Clarey merged them (and added still more abbreviations).
- Minimal guidance for studying.
- Insufficient and incomplete material at each chapter. Some rules may not appear in the passages chosen.

This guide addresses the first problem. [Cricket’s Shorthand Tips](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zUC87XQtrLZB-0UZuWFSu_Sjv29id98xBRUQH7nsmrw/edit?usp=sharing) addresses the second. The third, however, requires more work than any are willing to do. Once you've practiced Orthic's rules, the dictation exercises from other shorthand books may be more useful than random text since they focus on just a few rules at a time. Texts similar to what you will be writing will be more useful than texts from other fields.

This book attempts to be useful to both new and advanced learners, and is organized as follows:

- Alphabet. One to one conversion of letters to symbols. After this you will be able to write, but many joins will be awkward. Keep reading.
- Joins. When you finish this section, you will be at the Fully Written level. Speedbuilding at this level is not advised. Excessive practice will train your hand and brain to write fully – even when it’s not necessary. Do the exercises as described, so you are 80% comfortable with the basics, then move on.
- Basic. This adds a few rules and abbreviations that are definitely worth learning, comparable to the Supplement's Ordinary

- 
- All the Rules. This lists all the rules in alphabetical order.

- Basic
- Intermediate. This level adds more rules and abbreviations.
- Reporting. 
- 


It begins with the alphabet and common joins for the Fully Written level, then adds basic rules for the Ordinary Style (also called Correspondence).



as a reference book. Rules are presented in alphabetical order. Each rule is marked with learning level and source. New writers should stick to the Fully Written level (FW). Intermediate writers can add Abbreviated (Ab). Advanced can add Reporting (R). Where the books did not agree on the level of a rule, I assigned the level based on complexity and frequency. I might make separate documents later: FW only, FW and Ab, and All levels. That would, however, require that all updates be applied to multiple documents. 

New writers should do the book in multiple passes. First

...
alphabet
joins
basic rules
advanced




In deciding what type of book to write, the author considered both an instructional manual (with information presented in an order most useful for those new to the subject), and a reference manual (most useful for advanced students needing to find an outline once given the standard orthography, and the standard orthography once given an outline). In the past, she has been taught, and successfuly used, the First Rule of Writing: Select one person as your primary audience.

In an act of most excellent hubris (in keeping with the style of the source documents), she has decided to ignore that most excellent advice. This manuscript is the result.

That language is fun to write but hard to read, so I'll stop.



Reading and copying the samples in the source documents will help "lock in" the rules. Each writer has a different feel to their letters. You should develop a style that works with your hand, and your sense of aesthetics.

From The Manual

> The present system is an adaptation of the alphabet and principles of Cursive Shorthand to the common orthography.
> 
> Two and a half years’ experience in teaching Cursive has convinced me that the difficulties which beginners find in learning to spell correctly by sound are much greater than I had previously imagined; and that it is unadvisable to attempt to introduce a phonetic system of shorthand at an early stage in education.
> 
> I have every reason to believe that the present adaptation of (Phonetic) Cursive to the common spelling will be found much more simple and easy to learn than any of the phonetic systems at present in vogue. There is very little to learn beyond an alphabet of 26 characters, and the method of joining them. In fact many students have succeeded in reading and writing the present system with nothing but the bare alphabet to guide them.
> 
> ...
> 
> The writing requires no great niceties of penmanship. No distinction is made, as in other systems, between thin strokes and thick. Only two sizes of character are employed, instead of three or four. 
>
> The vowel characters are connecting strokes joined in their natural order together with the consonants. The great majority of the signs are written on the ordinary slope of longhand, and the forms and distinctions between the characters are such as are already familiar to every one who has learnt to write in the ordinary style.
> 
> The system is strictly alphabetic. A letter is always represented by its alphabetic character. There are no alternative hooks and loops, or halving and doubling principles, to puzzle and distract the student. A word can be written in one way only. *(Cricket: True only at the Fully Written level. More details below.)* The rules are consequently very few, definite, and easy to apply. *(Cricket: This does not apply to Clarey's book.)*
> 
> In learning the system the student should work straight through the alphabet and following pages, writing and analysing every example as he comes to it. By the time he reaches the end of the joining rules he will thus have become thoroughly familiar with the alphabet. He will then be able to read through the specimen of the fully-written style, every word of which is spelt in full.

The above isn't strictly true.

See under Alphabet regarding sizes.

Words can be written more than one way. Spelling varies with country, and whether the student is comfortable leaving out silent letters, and how they handle vowels. It becomes even less standard once the optional abbrevations are considered. Even so, if you stick to the Abbreviated level, others (including Future You) will be able to read it.









This collection of publications does one thing better than most other shorthand systems. It shows the writing of more than one person. Callandar, while a bit messy, follows the standard rules. Stevens is similar in form,  begins neatly, then his hand tires by the end of the longer works. He does things that, while not important enough to be rules, make similar outlines a bit more distinct, for easier reading. Clarey's writing is very loopy. Seeing this variety encourages students to experiment for themselves rather than trying to duplicate shapes exactly. If you can read it a year from now, then it's written well-enough.

I encourage all writers to share their writing, and look at their colleagues' samples. Sources include (orthic.shorthand.fun), https://www.reddit.com/r/orthic/ , https://www.reddit.com/r/shorthand/ , and the Discord International Shorthand Society.

# Preview of Levels
 

From Clarey: Do not attempt to write fast before the hand is familiar with the forms of the characters. At first they should be drawn carefully, so that correctness and neatness may be secured. Speed will come with practice, but if attempted too soon will probably lead to bad and slovenly writing.

The Abbreviated level simplifies spelling and adds optional (but highly recommended) rules for writing less. Orthic does not distinguish between shortened words, prefixes, and suffixes. They are all called abbreviations. The original Manual separates this level from Reporting, and suggests that Correspondence be done at the Abbreviated level. The Supplement moves many abbreviations from Reporting to Abbreviated. The Teaching of Orthic Shorthand removes the distinction, and says, "The Reporting Style of Orthic is in no way essentially different from the Corresponding Style. There is little new to learn, and nothing to unlearn. It is simply the same methods of abbreviation as given in the Teacher’s Manual, part 1, extended."

The Teaching of Orthic Shorthand claims you can reach 60wpm after finishing the 9 week program (and doing a mere 15 minutes a day of homework). That is probably optimistic.



# Speed Potential

Looking just at stroke count (but not actually doing the work of counting), the Fully Written level is faster than Forkner, which is well-documented to exceed 100wpm. Orthic students have been reported to reach as high as 165 and 190wpm.

Newspaper articles with speed claims:\
https://www.reddit.com/r/orthic/comments/ehqac5/a_note_on_shorthand_in_medical_work_fa_brooks_st/ \
https://www.reddit.com/r/orthic/comments/ekpz4t/the_sydney_morning_herald_thu_23_dec_1909_190_wpm/ \
https://www.reddit.com/r/orthic/comments/eknxwh/the_sydney_morning_herald_fri_23_dec_1904_165_wpm/

For comparison, before computers, most educated adults could write cursive at 20-40wpm (words per minute). An introductory typing class, with 110 hours in class, required 20wpm to pass. Typical speeds are now 20-80wpm. Entry level office shorthand in the US required 60 or 80wpm; one person reports 120 to pass their 3-year program. Journalists in the UK needed 100wpm until fairly recently, and often considered shorthand their most difficult course. Current office shorthand requirement in other areas is 100-120. Toastmasters recommends 120 for formal speeches. Court reporting in California requires 200wpm for 10 minutes. https://www.courtreportersboard.ca.gov/applicants/skills_exam_faq.pdf

Time to reach that speed varies widely. It's often reported in "courses," with no indication of the hours in or out of class. A very rough estimate is 100 hours for 100wpm. 

Note: Unless you get very good at shorthand, it is not advisable to use it for lecture notes. You will spend more time thinking about the shorthand than about the lecture. Then, after class, you will have to read the  shorthand (assuming it's readable) to learn the material. Learn the material in class. Use a combination of Rozane's system for Consecutive Interpretation and Cornell Notes to record what you need to remember, and what you need to research.

# Publications and Source Material

Most of these, and some contributions from the community, are available on (orthic.shorthand.fun) .

Wording and examples are a mix of all sources and the author. If no reference is given, the rule is first written in the Manual.

### Cursive, sometimes called Phonetic Cursive
A Manual of Cursive Shorthand,\
Hugh L Callendar, 1889.\
https://archive.org/details/manualofcursives00calliala/manualofcursives00calliala/page/n5/mode/2up \
This is included for historical reasons only. It was Callendar’s first shorthand publication. Much of the book is dedicated to a systematic condemnation of Pitman. Callendar was fluent in Pitman. He was also a Victorian gentleman, lawyer, and engineer. It's a fun read.

### The Manual
A Manual of Orthographic Shorthand: The Cambridge System, \
Hugh L Callendar, 1891.\
https://orthic.shorthand.fun/manual \
“Two and a half years’ experience in teaching Cursive has convinced me that the difficulties which beginners find in learning to spell correctly by sound are much greater than I had previously imagined; and that it is unadvisable to attempt to introduce a phonetic system of shorthand at an early stage in education.”
This book has three levels: Fully-written, Ordinary (simple rules and abbreviations), and Reporting (a collection of ideas).

Jeremy W Sherman rendered it into Markdown, and added a few clarifications.

### The Supplement
Supplement to the Manual of Orthic Shorthand [Orthographic Cursive], \
Hugh L Callendar, 1982.\
https://orthic.shorthand.fun/supplement \
“It is now nearly a year since the publication of Orthographic Cursive. The approval with which it has been greeted on all sides has more than fulfilled the author’s expectations, and repaid him for the years which he has spent in the endeavour to devise a system of shorthand sufficiently simple for general use.”
…
“The object of the following pages is to supply fuller explanation and illustration of the methods of abbreviation given in the Manual as ‘Hints for the Reporting Style’ and to provide advanced writers of the system with additional matter for exercise and reading practice.”
This book moves many rules from Reporting to Ordinary, and adds abbreviations.

### Teaching (Parts 1 and 2)
The Teaching of Orthic Shorthand: A series of lessons for the use of teachers and students of Orthographic shorthand (Callendar's system), \
W Stevens, 1896\
https://orthic.shorthand.fun/teaching-pt1 \
https://orthic.shorthand.fun/teaching-pt2 \
“The following lessons have been drawn up for the use of teachers in the “Orthic” system of shorthand.”
…
“If teachers and students will only follow these hints, and the lessons, as they are laid down, not hurrying, immediate success will accrue to their efforts.”

This book is to be used in conjunction with the Manual and the Supplement. Part 1 covers the Manual in 9 lessons, divided into Fully Written and Abbreviated. It adds a few rules, and moves others. Part 2 claims to be "the same methods of abbrviation, extended," but I believe it's better classified as the Reporting level.

### Extended (Clarey)
Orthographic Cursive Shorthand (Orthic) ; The Cambridge System ; \
Hugh L Callendar ; \
Revised, Extended and Improved \
E Clarey, 1911 \
https://orthic.shorthand.fun/  under Resources\
This booklet is an update of the Manual, which merges rules from the Manual, the Supplement (and Teaching??), and adds many more. I would classify the entire book as Reporting level. 

### Notes on the Reporting Style
Notes on the Reporting Style of Orthic Shorthand, given by W. Stevens in 'The Teaching of Orthic Shorthand' (1896) , \
Reddit u/uwula, 2015 (2019 - 4 = 2015)\
https://drive.google.com/file/d/14sBSBwjT76eqooWqHTABaRk_ar_MeOeF/view \
https://web.archive.org/web/20230611082516/https://old.reddit.com/r/shorthand/comments/ag2pq0/notes_on_the_reporting_style_of_orthic_shorthand/ 

“At the request of a couple of users here, I've put together some notes on W. Stevens's The Teaching of Orthic Shorthand.”
…
“Stevens occasionally overdoes things. There is a great deal to admire here, but there are many rough edges as well, and you should expect to do some fine-tuning if you want to use Orthic in a reporting style. All rules should be taken as suggestions. I will recommend against a couple of them along the way, though you may of course disagree with me.”

# Practice Schedule

Teaching recommends only 15 minutes practice a day in addition to the lesson (which I assume is weekly).

[Swem](https://cricketb.wordpress.com/2020/02/12/systematic-speed-course-for-advanced-writers-swem/) recommends an hour a day, five days a week, with the first 15 minutes dedicated to a systematic review of the text, and the rest to one or perhaps two passages. He further recommends another two hour-long sessions a week, each divided into practicing new "phrases and expedients" from books, and "taking dictation from new material and reading it back."

As with all physica/mental skills, regular short practice is more effective than a few long, widely-spaced sessions.

# General Rules and Observations

## Write Smoothly

The characters are to be joined together smoothly, without lifting the pen, or making any unnecessary angles or breaks. All the more common and important joinings are fully explained and illustrated in ‘How to Write and Join the Characters’. -- The Manual

Learn to write and recognize groups of letters. The goal is to think of letter groups and entire words or even phrases as single units. "OP" looks like the number 7. "PH" looks like the number 6. When doing math, we write 7 and 6 in a single motion. It should be the same with shorthand. -- Cricket

## Doubled Letters

Doubled letters are shown, not by repeating the character, but by putting a dot below. Exception: ee.
``` odd, too, ee, sleep, peep, pup  ```

## Orthographic Spelling

All words, when written in full, are spelt according to the common orthography. 

## Diphthongs and Vowels

Vowels are all forward-motion strokes. Consonants are mostly vertical.

When two or more vowels come together forming a ‘diphthong’,  the angle between them is slurred or rounded off into a continuous curve. (Similar applies more than two vowels.)
```
ai = ,  oy = ,  ou = ,  eau = 
```
When, however, the vowels are separately sounded, either the characters are separated, or the angle between them is marked, as in the words 
```  re-enter, Oölite,  Deä,  create,  Leo,  fiasco,  serious,  fuel,  poem.
```
Do not overthink this. If in doubt, ask how 7 year old would write it. -- Cricket

## Dividing a Word

A word may always be divided if it happens to be convenient. The necessity for this, however, very seldom arises except in the case of compound words.  
```
lawsuit,  Woolwich,  virgin, bagpipes
```
## Punctuation
Punctuation is effected in the usual way, except the Hyphen , and the Dash . (They are the normal hyphen and dash, except a vertical stroke intersects each in the middle, like a plus sign. This distinguishes them from raised A (“and”) and raised O (“though”). -- Jeremy)


## Initial Cappitals

Initial capitals are marked thus using a long stroke falling from midline to baseline at 30 degrees from horizontal. 

Compare the Manual
```
Jack,  Clay,  S.E.,  L.S.W.R.
```
to Clarey
```
egs -- line goes through the letters
```

# How to Write and Join the Characters

This section will, with very little effort, make your writing much smoother. It is the last material for the Fully Written level.

## Sizes

The Manual claims that there are only two sizes. This is incorrect. Most shapes have only two sizes, but not all small shapes are the same size. Most shapes have two widths in the alphabet, but a tiny horizontal tick can be used to make joins easier, and many have "very wide" version.

Teaching suggests that large letters be three times the size of small letters, but most examples show the size is only doubled. Use what works for you. Some prefer to write very precisely, others are satisfied by readable.

Clarey(p3) says "The actual size of the characters may be varied according to circumstances, such as the Goodness fo the light and the writing materials. The minuteness of any kind of writing is limited by the size of the mallest characters. In Orthic the small size maybe made as small as desired, and the small circle may be reduced to a dot But it is best ot make the small characters about one-twelfth of an inch long (2.1mm), and the large ones at least twice as big.

## A
A  is a short horizontal connecting stroke. It forms the diphthongs  ai,  au,  ay.
Ay may be curved either way. The form under-ay is used whenever it joins more clearly or easily than the form over-ay, as after D T J Qu M N V  thus,  days,  quay; cp.  says,  hay. (So basically, use the smoothed y-a form after forward horizontal curves and after descenders. See also when to use the curved -ing, which is basically a double-size smoothed y-a. -- Jeremy)

B  is written like the letter lowercase cursive b, but with a more open loop and without the hook upwards at the end. It forms the compounds:

bd   rob’d

bj   object

bl   able

br   bray

bs   absurd

bt   subtract

bv   subvent

C  is written like the letter c, but it is not turned up at the end, unless followed by e.
Ch  is written and joined exactly like the longhand letter o; thus,  chair,  Christ,  ache, cp.  ahead.
Other compounds are:

ck   suckle

cl   close

cr   crutch

ct   act

D  and  t have similar characters, but that for d is made much flatter, and about three times as long. It forms the compounds:

dge   judge

dj 

dle   fiddle

dr   dread

dv 

dw   dwell

(The Supplement published a year later suggests in ordinary style always omitting the D from the prefix ADJ-, which is probably why no example is given. -- Jeremy)

E  is a short upstroke; it must not be confused with  s, which is written downwards.
Ea ea, both over and under may be curved either way like ay. The form under-ea is used except after MNPSYB. An angle must always be made after over-ea before td or s; thus  seat,  seas,  eat,  real,  pearl,  years. [Yes, this means the default form for ea is a smoothed a-e, so it’s usually backwards. You only use the smoothed e-a form after the consonants – including y and excepting c – in “subcompany”.]
The diphthongs ee , ei , ie  are all written upwards much more steeply than u.  steep, cp.  stupid. eu , ew   new.
F 
F is joined without an angle after vowels; thus, with i rounded out to flow straight into f if (not stiff i, awkward corner, f).
It is joined to following characters like the longhand letter s; thus,

ft   soft
fd   puff’d
fl   rifle
fr   afraid
fs   skiffs
G  is like the left-hand half of a capital G. It forms the compounds:

gh   high
gl   glory
gr   agree
gn   sign
H  is a large circle or backward loop beginning at the bottom. It is distinguished from ch  by the way it is joined; thus,  hat,  chat,  what,  which

I  is a short upstroke, like e, but dotted.
ia  may be curved either way like ea; thus, social, optician; chief.
J  is like the letter j, but is not dotted.

K  is like g, but is turned the other way. It is joined in the same way as f.

L  is a small circle or loop like  r, but is turned the opposite way, clockwise. [Jeremy: L leaps clockwise and hangs below, R runs in reverse and stands above.]
When standing by itself as an initial,  L is distinguished from  R by prefixing a short hair-stroke showing the way it is turned.
In other cases the distinction is obvious; cp.

	black		bread
	clay		crow
	addle		dry
	flow		fro
	glad		grade
	play		pray
	little		litre
	slay		Israël
	held		herd
	world		already
Other compounds are:

lf   half
lk   walk
lp   help
lt   wilt
lv   salve
M  is like  n, but much longer and flatter.

mp   imply
mb   limb
ms 
N  is like the first hook of the letter n.
No angle need be made in the compounds:

ng   singer
nsp   inspect
Other compounds are:

nc   since
nch   inches
nd   India
nf   infer
nj   injury
nl   unless
ns   sense
nt   sent
nk   sink
nqu   inquest
nv   invent
O  is made about three times as long as  a.
Oa is distinguished from o by writing the  a above; thus,  oar, cp.  or;  oak.
Other compounds are:

oi   toil
ou   out
oy   boys
P  is a long downstroke, like the upper half of the stroke of the letter lowercase p in cursive longhand. It is made about three times as long as  s.
In joining  s before and after  p, the s-tick is sloped backwards; thus

sp   spear
ps   cusps
Other compounds are:

ph   phrase  phlegm
pl   place
pr   present
pt   depth
phth 
Qu  is like the lower loop of the letter lowercase f in cursive longhand; it is turned the opposite way to  j.  esquire.

R  is a small circle like  L, but is always turned the opposite way, like the loop of the longhand letter lowercase e in cursive longhand. For examples, see L.
The compound  rce is written like the initial lowercase e in cursive longhand form of the longhand letter e; thus,  fierce. (I’ve never seen this style of cursive e used outside Callendar’s own writing. It is like the uppercase cursive E made like a mirrored, round 3, only it is written the height of a lowercase letter, and has an added leading hairstroke crossing above the midline to make the top circle of the e. The result is basically the counter-clockwise Orthic r sitting atop a half-height Orthic c with a rise at the end for the e. -- Jeremy)
Other compounds are:

rd 
rt 
rf 
rk   work
rn   learn
rp 
rs 
rv 
S  is a short downstroke like the tick at the beginning or end of a capital S.
When standing alone, as an initial, it is written straight down, thus a short, vertical stroke, to distinguish it clearly from the short, forward-slanted stroke e; cp.  S.E.
In the compound Sh  the h circle is made smaller for neatness; sh as in sha, where she a leaves from the middle of the s - "touch and reverse" -  is distinguished from sr as in sra, where the a leaves from the bottom of the s - "spin around and continue" - by the way it is joined; thus; cp.
 shed-  Tisri-  shred-  school
Other compounds are:

sc   scent
sk 
sl   slew
sm 
sn 
sp   sphere
squ   square
st   still
sw   answer
T  is like the hook at the end of the letter t.
Th  is written like the letter d. [Jeremy: That’s a looped-through version of the d Callendar often writes at the end of a word, as seen for example in “end” . That word also shows the funky e Callendar uses to explain how to write the compound rce.]
At the end of a word, the circle of the h need not be completed; thus,

 with

 both

Other compounds are:

tch   sketch
tle   turtle
tr   truth
tw   two
U  is a long up-stroke on a flat slope, making an angle of about  30° with the line.
U  is distinguished from ee  by being written much less steeply; cp.  seen,  sun.
Dipththongs

ua   guard
ui   suit
V  is distinguished from  ste by its size; cp.

 minster

 Minver

 stew

 view

W  is an upward hook, which may be turned either way.
The first [clockwise] form is always used at the beginning of a word, except before r. Thus

 way

 woe

 wet

cp.  write

wr  is distinguished from  th by its size.
wh  is made by enlarging the w hook so as to look like the h- circle; cp.  who,  ha.
ws ; at the end of a word the addition of the s tick to the w hook forms a loop; thus

 sews

 cows

 laws

Other compounds are:

wk   hawk
wl   owls
wn   dawn
X 
No angle need be made in:

xh   exhort
xp   expense
xt   extent
Y 

 yacht

 yet

 yore

 yule

Z 

 daze

 Fitz
