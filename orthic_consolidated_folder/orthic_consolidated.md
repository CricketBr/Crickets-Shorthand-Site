# Introduction to Orthic Consolidated

Orthic shorthand is a good first shorthand for most students. It is quick to learn at the Fully Written Level, and multiple levels can be used in a single sentence without confusion. Based on stroke counts, its speed potential is comparable to other office and personal use shorthands. The Abbreviated and Reporting levels are even faster.

In keeping with tradition, this book begins with a list of the deficiencies of previous books:
- Rules are spread out over too many publications. Instead of printing a revised Manual, they printed a Supplement and a Teaching booklet (with a few more abbreviations). Then Clarey wrote Revised, Extended and Improved.
- Minimal guidance for studying and goals.
- Insufficient and incomplete material at each chapter. Some rules may not appear in the passages chosen.

This book addresses the first problem. [Cricket’s Shorthand Tips](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zUC87XQtrLZB-0UZuWFSu_Sjv29id98xBRUQH7nsmrw/edit?usp=sharing) addresses the second. The third, however, requires more work than any are willing to do. Once you've practiced Orthic's rules, the dictation exercises from other shorthand books may be more useful than random text since they focus on just a few rules at a time. Texts similar to what you will be writing will be more useful than texts from other fields.

This collection of publications does one thing better than most other shorthand systems: It shows the writing of more than one person. Callendar, while a bit messy, follows the standard rules. Stevens is similar in form,  begins neatly, then his hand tires by the end of the longer works. He does things that, while not important enough to be rules, make similar outlines a bit more distinct, for easier reading. Clarey's writing is very loopy. Seeing this variety encourages students to experiment for themselves rather than trying to duplicate shapes exactly. If you can read it a year from now, then it's written well-enough.

This document is structured the same as Teaching but with the material from the other books incorporated and labeled with the source. You may want to stick with the Manual and Supplement. Some of the suggestions in Revised take more time to learn and remember than they save in writing. The wording varies. Sometimes I listed the source. Other times I did not.

# From the Introduction to the Manual

> The present system is an adaptation of the alphabet and principles of Cursive Shorthand to the common orthography.
> ...
> I have every reason to believe that the present adaptation of (Phonetic) Cursive to the common spelling will be found much more simple and easy to learn than any of the phonetic systems at present in vogue. There is very little to learn beyond an alphabet of 26 characters, and the method of joining them. In fact many students have succeeded in reading and writing the present system with nothing but the bare alphabet to guide them.
> ...
> The writing requires no great niceties of penmanship. No distinction is made, as in other systems, between thin strokes and thick. Only two sizes of character are employed, instead of three or four. 
>
> The vowel characters are connecting strokes joined in their natural order together with the consonants. The great majority of the signs are written on the ordinary slope of longhand, and the forms and distinctions between the characters are such as are already familiar to every one who has learnt to write in the ordinary style.
> 
> The system is strictly alphabetic. A letter is always represented by its alphabetic character. There are no alternative hooks and loops, or halving and doubling principles, to puzzle and distract the student. A word can be written in one way only. *(Cricket: True only at the Fully Written level, if everyone is from the same country.)* The rules are consequently very few, definite, and easy to apply. > 

That's a bit optimistic, but good enough to start with. -- Cricket

# Speed Potential and Tips

Looking just at stroke count (but not actually doing the work of counting), the Fully Written level is faster than Forkner, which is well-documented to exceed 100wpm. Orthic students have been reported to reach as high as 165 and 190wpm.

Newspaper articles with speed claims:\
https://www.reddit.com/r/orthic/comments/ehqac5/a_note_on_shorthand_in_medical_work_fa_brooks_st/ \
https://www.reddit.com/r/orthic/comments/ekpz4t/the_sydney_morning_herald_thu_23_dec_1909_190_wpm/ \
https://www.reddit.com/r/orthic/comments/eknxwh/the_sydney_morning_herald_fri_23_dec_1904_165_wpm/

For comparison, before computers, most educated adults could write cursive at 20-40wpm (words per minute). An introductory typing class, with 110 hours in class, required 20wpm to pass. Typical current-day speeds are 20-80wpm. Entry level office shorthand in the US required 60 or 80wpm; one person reports 120 to pass their 3-year program. Journalists in the UK needed 100wpm until fairly recently, and often considered shorthand their most difficult course. Current office shorthand requirement in other areas is 100-120. Toastmasters recommends 120 for formal speeches. Court reporting in California requires 200wpm for 10 minutes. https://www.courtreportersboard.ca.gov/applicants/skills_exam_faq.pdf

Time to reach that speed varies widely. It's often reported in "courses," with no indication of the hours in or out of class, lessons per week, weeks per term, or terms per course. A very rough estimate is 100 hours for 100wpm. Be prepared for a plateau around 60wpm, and maybe a few more on the way to 100. That's just how our brains and bodies learn. Keep at it, and eventually the plateau will end.

Note: Unless you get very good at shorthand, it is not advisable to use it for lecture notes. You will spend more time thinking about the shorthand than about the lecture. Then, after class, you will have to read the  shorthand (assuming it's readable) to learn the material. Learn the material in class. Use a combination of Rozane's system for Consecutive Interpretation and Cornell Notes to record what you need to remember, and what you need to research. Practice your shorthand in lectures when the instructor keeps talking about a point you already understand.

Alternate between slow enough to be accurate, slow enough that you can keep up but don't have time to think, and so fast you can't quite keep up. Do this for long passages, and when you are drilling individual words, phrases, and sentence parts.

More advice on speedbuilding, and links to text-to-speech sites that are slow enough for early dictation, is here

# Levels
There Orthic has 4 main levels:
- Fully written. The alphabet and special joins for letters that do not work well together. This level is significantly faster than longhand, but you can do better with very little effort.
- Ordinary. Simplified spelling. Abbreviations for a few common prefixes and suffixes, including raising the word to indicate some positions. (Writing by mode / supra-lineal writing.)
- Abbreviated, aka Correspondence. Teaching Part 1, 9 lessons. Recommended for correspondence between members of the Cambridge Shorthand Society.
- Reporting. Advanced tips.

The Manual combines Ordinary and Abbreviated. The Supplement moves some rules from Reporting to Abbreviated or even Ordinary. Teaching Part 1 covers the first three levels in nine lessons, and claims s you can reach 60wpm after finishing the 9 week program (and doing a mere fifteen minutes a day of homework). That is probably optimistic.

Teaching, Part 2 begins by stating:
> The “Reporting Style” of Orthic is in no way essentially different from the “Corresponding Style.” There is little new to learn, and nothing to unlearn. It is simply the same methods of abbreviation as given in the Teacher’s Manual, part 1, extended.

Revised adds optional rules at all levels. In writing this guide, I chose to merge these rules with the main text, clearly marked with the source. This keeps all the rules in an easily-searchable form, hopefully without adding too much confusion for those who wish to ignore those found only in Revised.

# Publications and Source Material

Most of these, and some contributions from the community, are available on (orthic.shorthand.fun). (https://www.reddit.com/r/orthic/) has examples and discussion from the community.

Wording and examples are a mix of all sources and the author. If no reference is given, the rule first appears in the Manual. 

### Cursive, sometimes called Phonetic Cursive
A Manual of Cursive Shorthand,\
Hugh L Callendar, 1891.\
https://archive.org/details/manualofcursives00calliala/manualofcursives00calliala/page/n5/mode/2up \
This is included for historical reasons only. It was Callendar’s first shorthand publication. It includes a systematic condemnation of Pitman. Callendar was fluent in Pitman. He was also a Victorian gentleman, lawyer, and engineer. It's a fun read.

### The Manual
A Manual of Orthographic Shorthand: The Cambridge System, \
Hugh L Callendar, 1891.\
https://orthic.shorthand.fun/manual \
> Two and a half years’ experience in teaching Cursive has convinced me that the difficulties which beginners find in learning to spell correctly by sound are much greater than I had previously imagined; and that it is unadvisable to attempt to introduce a phonetic system of shorthand at an early stage in education.
This book has three levels: Fully-written, Ordinary (simple rules and abbreviations), and Reporting (a collection of ideas).

Jeremy W Sherman rendered it into Markdown, and added a few clarifications.

### The Supplement
Supplement to the Manual of Orthic Shorthand [Orthographic Cursive], \
Hugh L Callendar, 1892.\
https://orthic.shorthand.fun/supplement \
> It is now nearly a year since the publication of Orthographic Cursive. The approval with which it has been greeted on all sides has more than fulfilled the author’s expectations, and repaid him for the years which he has spent in the endeavour to devise a system of shorthand sufficiently simple for general use.
> …
> The object of the following pages is to supply fuller explanation and illustration of the methods of abbreviation given in the Manual as ‘Hints for the Reporting Style’ and to provide advanced writers of the system with additional matter for exercise and reading practice.
This book moves many rules from Reporting to Ordinary, and adds more abbreviations.

### Teaching (Parts 1 and 2)
The Teaching of Orthic Shorthand: A series of lessons for the use of teachers and students of Orthographic shorthand (Callendar's system), \
W Stevens, 1896\
https://orthic.shorthand.fun/teaching-pt1 \
https://orthic.shorthand.fun/teaching-pt2 \
> The following lessons have been drawn up for the use of teachers in the “Orthic” system of shorthand.
…
> If teachers and students will only follow these hints, and the lessons, as they are laid down, not hurrying, immediate success will accrue to their efforts.
> ...
> Lesson 9: Conclusion: The pupils should with their present knowledge be able to write in supplement style, at least 60 words per minute, and to read fluently the Third Book of the Psalms, and the Magazine, and to correspond rapidly with any member of the Cambridge Shorthand Society

This book is to be used in conjunction with the Manual and the Supplement. Part 1 covers the Manual in 9 lessons, divided into Fully Written and Abbreviated. It adds a few rules, and moves others. Part 2 is the Reporting level, which it claims "is simply the same methods of abbreviation as given in the Teacher’s Manual, part 1, extended." I believe, however, that it should be a separate level.

### Revised, Extended and Improved (Clarey)

This book is an update of the Manual, which merges rules from the Manual, the Supplement ```and Teaching??```, and adds many more. I would classify the entire book as Reporting level, with an integrated review of simpler levels.

> At the request of a couple of users here, I've put together some notes on W. Stevens's The Teaching of Orthic Shorthand.
…
> Stevens occasionally overdoes things. There is a great deal to admire here, but there are many rough edges as well, and you should expect to do some fine-tuning if you want to use Orthic in a reporting style. All rules should be taken as suggestions. I will recommend against a couple of them along the way, though you may of course disagree with me.

# Practice Schedule

Teaching promises at least 60 words per minute in only fifteen minutes practice a day in addition to the lesson (which I assume is weekly). That's probably optimistic.

[Swem](https://cricketb.wordpress.com/2020/02/12/systematic-speed-course-for-advanced-writers-swem/) recommends an hour a day, five days a week, with the first fifteen minutes dedicated to a systematic review of the text, and the rest to one or perhaps two passages. He further recommends another two hour-long sessions a week, each divided into practicing new "phrases and expedients" from books, and "taking dictation from new material and reading it back."

As with all mental/physical skills, frequent short practice is more effective than longer but less often sessions.

# Lesson 1: Introduction to the alphabet
> Impress upon the pupils the necessity of becoming again “Babes in Learning”. They must have, as far as possible, an absolutely open mind, and commence, as children, by learning the alphabet.

Reading and copying the samples in the source documents will help "lock in" the rules. Each writer has a different feel to their letters. You should develop a style that works with your hand, and your sense of aesthetics.

```Figs: Orthic written by Callendar, Stevens, Clarey,  Pitman accent, Gregg accent, and my own.```
```	alphabet in 2 lines , all writers ```

Several authors suggest the teacher compare the shorthand letters to parts of cursive or print letters to aid memory. I think that creates more confusion than it solves, but you might find it helpful.

## Orthographic Spelling

"All words, when written in full, are spelt according to the common orthography." 

## Two Sizes of Characters
The Manual claims that there are only two sizes. This is incorrect. Most shapes have only two sizes, but not all small shapes are the same size. Most shapes have two widths in the alphabet, but a tiny horizontal tick can be used to make joins easier, and many shapes have "very wide" version.

Teaching suggests that large letters be three times the size of small letters, but all the examples of actual text show the size is only doubled. Use what works for you. Some prefer to write very precisely, others are satisfied by readable. Aim for more precise than is necessary, especially before you learn the system, but do not aim for perfection.

> The actual size of the characters may be varied according to circumstances, such as the Goodness fo the light and the writing materials. The minuteness of any kind of writing is limited by the size of the mallest characters. In Orthic the small size maybe made as small as desired, and the small circle may be reduced to a dot But it is best ot make the small characters about one-twelfth of an inch long (2.1mm), and the large ones at least twice as big. -- Revised: General Rules


``` paper ```
Links to paper at various sizes. Clarey, 6mm, 7mm, 8mm -- US narrow, college and wide (exact or metrified?), give measurements and conversion, divide line in 3. Experiment with different sizes of writing. Too small will often lead to tension and slower writing. I write larger now than I did 30 years ago, mostly due to muscle changes from less writing and more computering.


```image -- alphabet between 2 lines```
```alphabet big chart with examples ```

## Write Smoothly

The characters are to be joined together smoothly, without lifting the pen, or making any unnecessary angles or breaks. All the more common and important joinings are fully explained and illustrated in ‘How to Write and Join the Characters’. -- The Manual

Learn to write and recognize groups of letters. The goal is to think of letter groups and entire words or even phrases as single units. "OP" looks like the number 7. "PH" looks like the number 6. When doing math, we write 7 and 6 in a single motion. It should be the same with shorthand. -- Cricket

## Circles
H is a large circle. In the base form, it starts at the bottom and starts by going up to the right, so it sits on top of the line and joins smoothly with letters on either side.

L always goes clockwise. R always goes counter-clockwise. When writing L or R without neighbouring strokes to show direction, add a tiny entry stroke.

Other shorthand systems (notably Gregg) base direction on the surrounding strokes. This can get confusing when switching systems. 

## Doubled Letters
To double a letter, write it once an put a dot under it to indicate the doubling. Even better, only write it once and trust that you'll be able to read it. Spell like a child.

The exception to this is **ee** which is written as a double-length **e** with the dot for the ***i** added in the middle (**ie**) or top (**ei**). (Advanced: Omit the dot for most words.) 
```pup  pep  peep odd, too, ee, sleep, peep, pup```

## Dividing a Word
A word may always be divided if it happens to be convenient. The necessity for this, however, very seldom arises except in the case of compound words.  
```
lawsuit,  Woolwich,  virgin, bagpipes
```
## Punctuation
Punctuation is effected in the usual way, except the Hyphen , and the Dash . (They are the normal hyphen and dash, except a vertical stroke intersects each in the middle, like a plus sign. This distinguishes them from raised A (“and”) and raised O (“though”). -- Jeremy)

## Initial Cappitals
Initial capitals are marked using a long stroke falling from midline to baseline at 30 degrees from horizontal. 

Compare the Manual
```
Jack,  Clay,  S.E.,  L.S.W.R.

```
egs -- line goes through the letters
 
## Homework
sample -- alphabet between 2 lines, all sources including mine
- Write the alphabet and sample words between two lines. Writing creates more nerve connections than reading aloud. If possible without turning too many heads, say the letters out loud. For now, use the relative sizes as marked. You will soon learn when you can be less precise.
- Fill out the following chart, which groups similar shapes together. Look for patterns between letters, their print and longhand forms, and your lips and tongue as you say them. The angles do not have to be exact, but they do need to be consistent.
``` chart for patterns include angles```
- Repeat the alphabet chart and sample words until you are comfortable with them, but not necessarily fluent.

## End Lesson 1

It is tempting to start writing new material at this stage, but it is not (yet) worth your time to do so. Wait until the end of Lesson 3.

# Lesson 2: Joinings Vowels

All vowels, and only vowels, are straight, right moving strokes.
``` vowels, include y```
Where vowels combine into a single sound (as perceived by the untrained ear), the angle between them is rounded.
``` all the vowel joins, as angled and curved```

Where they are pronounced separately, or if you wish to make the spelling clear, keep the angle, add a small jog, lift the pen and write one above the other, or write only one and go back to add the other later.

Note: Callendar refers to all vowel groups that are sounded as single vowels (to the untrained ear) as diphthongs. Modern phoneticists and singers use a different definition. They also divide many vowels that most of us think of as single vowels into component parts. What most of us hear as **I** or **eye** is actually two sounds: ah and ee.)

```
all methods for
chaos, re-enter, Oolite (umlaut), create, Leo, fiasco, serious, fuel, poem -- from manual
```
oa and ao are written by either adding a short jog between them, or by omitting the A, then going back and adding it above the O. It is the writer's choice. (Leaving out one of the vowels is even faster. Do that when possible.)
``` chaos, , /// from clarey?  both methods```
``` oar -- both methods, and leaving out the A ```

Many joined vowels can be exchanged to make joining to surrounding letters easier, and less likely to degrade at speed. Y can be replaced with an upstroke if that makes a better angle.

```
ae, ea , and examples of words
ai, ia  -- nope, ai always in the correct order
au, ua
ay, ya
eau
all the above with o
ye, obey -- teaching

check all books, be sure not to overgeneralize

go through the long list of joins in each book, since not all the vowel-to-vowel joins are in the vowel section
```

In general, if the preceding letter ends going up, the vowel should begin by going down, and vice versa. If the preceding letter ends horizontal, the vowel should begin by going up or down. The same rules apply to the letter following the vowels. There is a third form for **ea** for use between downstrokes. Choose the version that is clearest to write. 

``` seat, seas, eat, real, pearl, years** manual: joining```







## Homework
Vocabulary practice, two methods.

As stated earlier, the end goal is to think of each word as a single unit, not individual letters. That's not necessary at this stage. Aim for accuracy and comfort, not speed.
## Accordian Fold
Write the words you have encountered so far down the left of the paper. In the next column, write the outlines. Be very sure to write them correctly. Now hide the first column by folding it underneath and, in the next column, write each word in longhand. Unfold, check your work, and mark any that you struggle with. Now hide the first shorthand column and write the shorthand, check, and mark. Continue hiding and alternating until the page is full. When the page is full, repeat the process with any words you struggled with more than half the time, or in the last two repetitions. Continue until you are confident with all the words.
## Paper-Saving
This method makes it easier to think you can read a word even if you can't. Say each word out loud to prevent that.
Write the words you have encountered so far down the left of one sheet of paper, and the outlines in the second column. Make sure these are correctly written. Hold a second sheet over the shorthand column, so you can see the longhand. Write each word in shorthand, going down the column. Mark problem words. Fold that column under and repeat. 
## Rows
Same as above, but write across rows instead of down columns.
## Spaced Repetition
With either of the above methods, if you get a word correct two days in a row, promote it to the next list. Review that list every 2 days. Again, if you get a word correct twice at this level, move it up to the next list (reviewed half as often as the previous list). If you get a word wrong, bring it all the way back to the daily review list.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system

Programs such as Anki keep records for you. You will learn better if you actually write the outlines than just imagine them and check your imagination against the answer.

## End Lesson 2

The next lesson is long, and will cover all remaining joins.

# Lesson 3: Joining Consonants

Be warned: This section is long, but necessary. Rules are from the Manual:Joining unless specified. You may want to focus on the rules from the Manual, Supplement, and Teaching at first, and leave Revised for your second time through. The first three are sufficient for correspondence. The fourth has some good ideas, but also some rules that most people rarely need.

```table of contents to the start of each letter ```

``` 
"see notes below" and put the comparisons there
or "compare to ..." in each one
```


## A
A  is a short horizontal connecting stroke. It forms the diphthongs  ai,  au,  ay.
Ay may be curved either way. The form under-ay is used whenever it joins more clearly or easily than the form over-ay, as after D T J Qu M N V  thus,  days,  quay; cp.  says,  hay. (So basically, use the smoothed y-a form after forward horizontal curves and after descenders. See also when to use the curved -ing, which is basically a double-size smoothed y-a. - Jeremy)



B  is written like the letter lowercase cursive b, but with a more open loop and without the hook upwards at the end. It forms the compounds:

bd   rob’d

bj   object

bl   able

br   bray

bs   absurd

bt   subtract

bv   subvent

C  is written like the letter c, but it is not turned up at the end, unless followed by e.
Ch  is written and joined exactly like the longhand letter o; thus,  chair,  Christ,  ache, cp.  ahead.
Other compounds are:

ck   suckle

cl   close

cr   crutch

ct   act

D  and  t have similar characters, but that for d is made much flatter, and about three times as long. It forms the compounds:

dge   judge

dj 

dle   fiddle

dr   dread

dv 

dw   dwell

[Jeremy: The Supplement published a year later suggests in ordinary style always omitting the D from the prefix ADJ-, which is probably why no example is given.]

E  is a short upstroke; it must not be confused with  s, which is written downwards.
Ea ea, both over and under may be curved either way like ay. The form under-ea is used except after MNPSYB. An angle must always be made after over-ea before td or s; thus  seat,  seas,  eat,  real,  pearl,  years. [Yes, this means the default form for ea is a smoothed a-e, so it’s usually backwards. You only use the smoothed e-a form after the consonants – including y and excepting c – in “subcompany”.]
The diphthongs ee , ei , ie  are all written upwards much more steeply than u.  steep, cp.  stupid. eu , ew   new.
F 
F is joined without an angle after vowels; thus, with i rounded out to flow straight into f if (not stiff i, awkward corner, f).
It is joined to following characters like the longhand letter s; thus,

ft   soft
fd   puff’d
fl   rifle
fr   afraid
fs   skiffs
G  is like the left-hand half of a capital G. It forms the compounds:

gh   high
gl   glory
gr   agree
gn   sign
H  is a large circle or backward loop beginning at the bottom. It is distinguished from ch  by the way it is joined; thus,  hat,  chat,  what,  which

I  is a short upstroke, like e, but dotted.
ia  may be curved either way like ea; thus, social, optician; chief.
J  is like the letter j, but is not dotted.

K  is like g, but is turned the other way. It is joined in the same way as f.

L  is a small circle or loop like  r, but is turned the opposite way, clockwise. [Jeremy: L leaps clockwise and hangs below, R runs in reverse and stands above.]
When standing by itself as an initial,  L is distinguished from  R by prefixing a short hair-stroke showing the way it is turned.
In other cases the distinction is obvious; cp.

	black		bread
	clay		crow
	addle		dry
	flow		fro
	glad		grade
	play		pray
	little		litre
	slay		Israël
	held		herd
	world		already
Other compounds are:

lf   half
lk   walk
lp   help
lt   wilt
lv   salve

supplement: bl , br
pl, pr, fl, fr, ml, mr



M  is like  n, but much longer and flatter.

mp   imply
mb   limb
ms 
N  is like the first hook of the letter n.
No angle need be made in the compounds:

ng   singer
nsp   inspect
Other compounds are:

nc   since
nch   inches
nd   India
nf   infer
nj   injury
nl   unless
ns   sense
nt   sent
nk   sink
nqu   inquest
nv   invent
O  is made about three times as long as  a.
Oa is distinguished from o by writing the  a above; thus,  oar, cp.  or;  oak.
Other compounds are:

oi   toil
ou   out
oy   boys
P  is a long downstroke, like the upper half of the stroke of the letter lowercase p in cursive longhand. It is made about three times as long as  s.
In joining  s before and after  p, the s-tick is sloped backwards; thus

sp   spear
ps   cusps
Other compounds are:

ph   phrase  phlegm
pl   place
pr   present
pt   depth
phth 
Qu  is like the lower loop of the letter lowercase f in cursive longhand; it is turned the opposite way to  j.  esquire.

R  is a small circle like  L, but is always turned the opposite way, like the loop of the longhand letter lowercase e in cursive longhand. For examples, see L.
The compound  rce is written like the initial lowercase e in cursive longhand form of the longhand letter e; thus,  fierce. [Jeremy: I’ve never seen this style of cursive e used outside Callendar’s own writing. It is like the uppercase cursive E made like a mirrored, round 3, only it is written the height of a lowercase letter, and has an added leading hairstroke crossing above the midline to make the top circle of the e. The result is basically the counter-clockwise Orthic r sitting atop a half-height Orthic c with a rise at the end for the e.]
Other compounds are:

rd 
rt 
rf 
rk   work
rn   learn
rp 
rs 
rv 
S  is a short downstroke like the tick at the beginning or end of a capital S.
When standing alone, as an initial, it is written straight down, thus a short, vertical stroke, to distinguish it clearly from the short, forward-slanted stroke e; cp.  S.E.
In the compound Sh  the h circle is made smaller for neatness; sh as in sha, where she a leaves from the middle of the s - "touch and reverse" -  is distinguished from sr as in sra, where the a leaves from the bottom of the s - "spin around and continue" - by the way it is joined; thus; cp.
 shed-  Tisri-  shred-  school
Other compounds are:

sc   scent
sk 
sl   slew
sm 
sn 
sp   sphere
squ   square
st   still
sw   answer
T  is like the hook at the end of the letter t.
Th  is written like the letter d. [Jeremy: That’s a looped-through version of the d Callendar often writes at the end of a word, as seen for example in “end” . That word also shows the funky e Callendar uses to explain how to write the compound rce.]
At the end of a word, the circle of the h need not be completed; thus,

 with

 both

Other compounds are:

tch   sketch
tle   turtle
tr   truth
tw   two
U  is a long up-stroke on a flat slope, making an angle of about  30° with the line.
U  is distinguished from ee  by being written much less steeply; cp.  seen,  sun.
Dipththongs

ua   guard
ui   suit
V  is distinguished from  ste by its size; cp.

 minster

 Minver

 stew

 view

W  is an upward hook, which may be turned either way.
The first [clockwise] form is always used at the beginning of a word, except before r. Thus

 way

 woe

 wet

cp.  write

wr  is distinguished from  th by its size.
wh  is made by enlarging the w hook so as to look like the h- circle; cp.  who,  ha.
ws ; at the end of a word the addition of the s tick to the w hook forms a loop; thus

 sews

 cows

 laws

Other compounds are:

wk   hawk
wl   owls
wn   dawn
X 
No angle need be made in:

xh   exhort
xp   expense
xt   extent

## Homework

### Make a Table of the Joins

Make a table such as below (but larger) and fill it in. Repeat this exercise each day, until you reach 80% accuracy. You will learn the rest as you practice reading and writing sentences. When you start writing new material and suspect there is a better way to join letters, check the table. Also check the Revised suggestions, if you haven't included them in the table.

I know you're going to skip the table and move right to the reading. That's ok. You can do it later, but I suggest you do it at least three times before starting the next chapter.

``` table ```

## Reading and Practice

Pick one of the following and read it. If you cannot read a word, break it into the component letters, try again, then read the rest of the sentence. Then try the word again, bearing in mind you may have misread a letter. Then check the key. There is no need to struggle with an unknown word at this stage. (Eventually this will be an important skill, but for now quantity is more important than quality.)

Repeat this a few times before writing. It is ok if you remember bits instead of reading them at this stage. You will learn them carefully when you copy them.

```
images and keys -- include images for downloading 
maybe do my introduction, in keeping with tradition
```
## Writing Practice 

Mark up the shorthand plate with any words you still struggle with.

### Four Column Method

This method combines reading and writing practice. If you are using a standard letter or A4 notebook, divide each page in half down the middle, so you can see all four columns at once. If you are using another type of paper, find a way to see four columns at once, each approximately 3in (7cm) wide.

Copy from the text to the first column. Read a few words out loud, then write them. Think about each letter as you write it -- this time. The writing must be accurate!

Copy from the first column to the second, using the same system, but try to think of common words as single units instead of collections of letters. For now, a common word is any word that appears more than a few times in the sample. Again, accuracy is more important than speed.

Copy from the second column to the third, using the same system. Try to write fluidly.

By now, there will be some mistakes in the copy -- like in a game of telephone. Compare this one to the text carefully.

Copy the fourth column from the text, so that the last column is accurate. Your brain and body will remember the last time more than the middle times.

Some teachers say to copy the third column to the fourth, but I think at this stage it is better to reread the accurate version.

Aim for fluid writing at this stage, but do not worry about speed.

### Four Row Method

As above, but begin by writing and leaving 3 or more blank lines between each new line. Then copy from each line to the row below. This method is more common than the column method, but I find it less useful.

## Dictation Practice

Use one of the online dictation sites to take dictation on the passage you worked on. Start at 20wpm, try that a few times, then move up to 25, then 30. You can also start by converting typed copy to shorthand. You don't really need a voice at this stage. Carefully check your writing after each attempt. You will feel some of the common words "lock in" as single thoughts instead of a collection of letters. It feels like cheating, but it's the end goal, much like memorizing multiplication tables vs drawing and counting grids of dots.

``` links ```


## End Lesson Three and Fully Written

Aim for 80% comfort at this stage. It's ok to look up what you don't know. Confidently writing something incorrectly is more of a problem.

You can now write new material. I do not, however, recommend building speed past 30 or 40 just yet, and definitely not building speed on anything with words not presented in the text. Work at this level until you are 80% confident, regardless of speed, then move on, before hand becomes fixed at Fully Written.

## Lesson Four: Basic Abbreviation









# Ordinary Style
The original Ordinary style, recommended for use "used in correspondence and in ordinary writing," consists of four rules 13?? endings, the General Method of Abbreviation (and a warning not to over-use it), several phrases, and a list of common abbreviations.

## Omit A and O before M and N
The vowels **a** and **o** are omitted before m and n, except initially and in rare words; thus,  c(a)n or c(o)n,  al(o)ne,  w(o)m(a)n. An omission of this kind can always be corrected, if desired, by writing the omitted character above; thus,  b(an)d,  b(o)nd.

This sounds scary, but works well. If there is no vowel written, then the vowel is either **a**, **o**, or a minor vowel (if the writer trained in another system that leaves out minor vowels).

Note: **Can*** has a separate abbreviation, listed below.

## Drop the Dots
We rarely need to know that a letter is doubled in order to read the word. If a word does not make sense with an **e**, try an **i**. Again, this sounds scary, but works very well in practice. Gregg leaves out most minor vowels, and uses the same symbol for short-e, long-e, short-i.

## Let -Y stand unaltered
In adding inflections to words ending in y, the y is not changed to i or ie; thus,  applyd,  trys,  easyst,  happyr.

## Write Common Prefixes Above the Line

## Supra-Lineal Writing (aka Writing Above the Line)
The Manual uses this only for TH at the Ordinary level. The Supplement suggests broader use. Using this for prefixes is a special case of writing with Modes, where letters replaced by a slight gap, and indicated by writing the remainder of the word at a different level. Further details on that are in the secton on Modes.

### Eve
ever
every, evening, evnet , evident, evil
Exception: Even is written e’en , to distinguish it from than or then.


Be
This prefix is peculiar to a special class of English words, and may also be expressed by writing above the line.

The word be is expressed by a dot above the line ; been and being by n  and straight ‑ing ; the former will not be found to clash with than.

Note: This is used only for words with be as a prefix, not 

Per-, pro-, pre-
These prefixes, being Latin, will not clash with any of the above English prefixes, and may be expressed in the same way with great saving of time and space. [E.g.  person,  present,  promise.]

Pre- and pro- are distinguished from per, if necessary, by retaining the vowels e and o. The cases, however, in which it is necessary to make the distinction are very rare.

When any of these prefixes occur in the middle of a word after another prefix, as in the words unbelief, compromise, etc., they are expressed by Mode (1), that is to say by writing the terminal portion of the word close above and to the right of the initial prefix. [E.g.  comprehend.] In the prefixes super, supra, hyper, the per is similarly expressed.

The allied prefix pri may be expressed in the same way as pre in some common words. [E.g.,  private.]

Para, peri
These Greek prefixes may also be expressed by supra-linear writing for the same reason. Peri is distinguished by retaining the i; it may be regarded as a special case of per.

Examples of these prefixes will be found in the list of ‘Examples of Abbreviations.’



Replace TH- with Writing Higher

This is an early use of *modes* or position writing.

Initial Th is omitted in all common words. The omission is shown by writing the rest of the word above the line; thus,  the,  they,  this,  them,  tho’,  that.

Exception: The character a  written above the line stands for the word and.



## Abbreviate common endings
Some common terminations are abbreviated as shown in the following list:

Ed. The e may generally be omitted; thus,

 us’d

 kiss’d

 stirr’d

Ful  fl

 useful

 beautyfully

Hood  hd

 manhood
Ing  ing

 using

 saying

 seeming

This form is used only for the inflection -ing and not in such words as  king; cp.  sing,  singing.
It is better to curve the stroke, thus , after d, m, n, t, v, and vowels [here including y as in “scrying”].
Ight  t, below

 night
 light
Ion  un, dotted if necessary

 action
Ity  y, above

 ab(il)ities
 pec(uliar)ity
Less  ls

 thankless
 fearlessness
Ly  y below

 nearly
 easily
 dailies
Ment  mt

 comment
 arrangement
Ness  ns [J: Don’t use this. Write ness as detached ess instead per the general method of abbreviation. See ‘ness’ in the Supplement. Then per that method use ns for ations.]

 happyness
 thoughtfulness
Ough  o’

 ought
 brought
Ther  hr

 others
Ward  ard

 towards
[J: Note that each links to itself, to aid in teaching fellow writers.]

The General Method
The general method of abbreviating long words is to write only the first syllable, and, if necessary, to indicate the termination by writing the last letter or two, separated by a small interval from the first part; thus,

 dif(feren)t

 dif(feren)ce

 ack(nowledge)

 esp(eciall)y

 cir(cumstan)ce

 extr(aordinar)y

 rep(resentati)ve

In many cases the termination may be joined, as in the last three examples.

## Phrases
Words may often be joined together provided that they are closely connected in sense. This applies especially to common words, auxiliaries, and particles, such as those contained in the list [of common words in the next section]: ex. gr.

 able to do
 as it is
 I am not
 I have had
 I shall be very
 to be
 ought to have been
 with a view to

## Modes, Including Prefix






## End of Ordinary Style

You are now ready to read the material written in the Ordinary Style. https://orthic.shorthand.fun/reading . You are also ready to start building speed. I strongly suggest you start with existing well-written material, and follow Swem's guidelines for regular review of the rules.


If you create your own material, let it sit for at least a day, then read it carefully and rewrite it before building speed with it. If you write something wrong at this stage, it will be hard to retrain your hand correctly. The Reddit Orthic and Shorthand Communities, and Discord's International Shorthand Society, have Quote of the Day (QOTD) and Quote of the Week (QOTW) which often have comments and corrections.

## Application to Foreign Languages

The Manual suggests a few changes for several languages, but mostly relies on translitteration to the standard English alphabet.
