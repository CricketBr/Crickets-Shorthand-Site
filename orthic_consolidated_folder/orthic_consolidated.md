# Introduction

This document will consolidate all the rules and advice into a single document, with links to the other documents for practice material.

Orthic shorthand is a good first shorthand for most students. It is quick to learn at the Fully Written Level, and multiple levels can be used in a single sentence without confusion. Based on stroke counts, its speed potential is comparable to other office and personal use shorthands. The Abbreviated and Reporting levels are even faster.

From The Manual (as typed by Jeremy W. Sherman)

> The present system is an adaptation of the alphabet and principles of Cursive Shorthand to the common orthography.
> 
> Two and a half years’ experience in teaching Cursive has convinced me that the difficulties which beginners find in learning to spell correctly by sound are much greater than I had previously imagined; and that it is unadvisable to attempt to introduce a phonetic system of shorthand at an early stage in education.
> 
> I have every reason to believe that the present adaptation of (Phonetic) Cursive to the common spelling will be found much more simple and easy to learn than any of the phonetic systems at present in vogue. There is very little to learn beyond an alphabet of 26 characters, and the method of joining them. In fact many students have succeeded in reading and writing the present system with nothing but the bare alphabet to guide them.
> 
> ...
> 
> The writing requires no great niceties of penmanship. No distinction is made, as in other systems, between thin strokes and thick. Only two sizes of character are employed, instead of three or four. The vowel characters are connecting strokes joined in their natural order together with the consonants. The great majority of the signs are written on the ordinary slope of longhand, and the forms and distinctions between the characters are such as are already familiar to every one who has learnt to write in the ordinary style. (Cricket: True only at the Fully Written level. More details below.)
> 
> The system is strictly alphabetic. A letter is always represented by its alphabetic character. There are no alternative hooks and loops, or halving and doubling principles, to puzzle and distract the student. A word can be written in one way only. (Cricket: True only at the Fully Written level. More details below.) The rules are consequently very few, definite, and easy to apply.
> 
> In learning the system the student should work straight through the alphabet and following pages, writing and analysing every example as he comes to it. By the time he reaches the end of the joining rules he will thus have become thoroughly familiar with the alphabet. He will then be able to read through the specimen of the fully-written style, every word of which is spelt in full.

I would argue about the two sizes. At advanced levels there are three horizontal sizes, and the option to use medium-size circles instead of large for some letters, to make reading faster. When training your hand, make the small circles tiny, and the large circles large. Make the wide letters medium, and the narrow letters very narrow. This advice will be repeated in The Alphabet. As for spelling? Again, it's only true at the Fully Written level if the student only has one way to spell the word. At the Abbreviated level, it depends how many of the optional abbreviations you use.

The Fully Written level simply replaces each letter with a single-stroke equivalent, and provides “joins” to combine letters that otherwise do not work well together. You do not need to relearn how to spell or to guess at letters that were left out. Speedbuilding at this level is not advised. Excessive practice will train your hand and brain to write fully – even when it’s not necessary. Do the exercises as described, so you are 80% comfortable with the basics, then move to Abbreviated.

From Clarey: Do not attempt to write fast before the hand is familiar with the forms of the characters. At first they should be drawn carefully, so that correctness and neatness may be secured. Speed will come with practice, but if attempted too soon will probably lead to bad and slovenly writing.

The Abbreviated level simplifies spelling and adds optional (but highly recommended) rules for writing less. Orthic does not distinguish between shortened words, prefixes, and suffixes. They are all called abbreviations. 
The author of The Teaching of Orthic Shorthand claims you can reach 60wpm after finishing the 9 week program (and doing a mere 15 minutes a day of homework). That is probably optimistic.

The final level, Reporting, has more optional rules. Some of these were promoted to Abbreviated in later publications.

The existing publications have a few deficiencies:
- Rules are spread out over too many publications. Instead of printing a revised Manual, they printed a Supplement, and a Teaching booklet (with a few more abbreviations), and then Clarey merged them (and added still more abbreviations).
- Minimal guidance for studying.
- Insufficient and incomplete material at each chapter. Some rules may not appear in the passages chosen.

This guide addresses the first problem. [Cricket’s Shorthand Tips](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zUC87XQtrLZB-0UZuWFSu_Sjv29id98xBRUQH7nsmrw/edit?usp=sharing) addresses the second. The third, however, requires more work than any are willing to do. Once you've practiced Orthic's rules, the dictation exercises from other shorthand books can be used, and will be more useful since they focus on just a few rules at a time.

This collection of publications does one thing better than most other shorthand books. It shows the writing of more than one person. Callandar, while a bit messy, follows the standard rules. Stevens is similar in form,  begins neatly, then his hand tires by the end of the longer works. He does things that, while not important enough to be rules, make similar outlines a bit more distinct, for easier reading. Clarey's writing is very loopy. Seeing this variety encourages students to experiment for themselves rather than trying to duplicate shapes exactly. If you can read it, then it's written well-enough.

I encourage all writers to share their writing, and look at their colleagues' samples. Sources include (orthic.shorthand.fun), https://www.reddit.com/r/orthic/ , https://www.reddit.com/r/shorthand/ , and the Discord International Shorthand Society.

# Speed Potential

Looking just at stroke count (but not actually doing the work of counting), the Fully Written level is faster to Forkner, which is well-documented to exceed 100wpm. Orthic students have been reported to reach as high as 165 and 190wpm.

Newspaper articles with speed claims:\

https://www.reddit.com/r/orthic/comments/eknxwh/the_sydney_morning_herald_fri_23_dec_1904_165_wpm/

For comparison, before computers, most educated adults could write cursive at 20-40 wpm. An introductory typing class, with 110 hours in class, required 20wpm to pass. Typical speeds are now 20-80wpm. Entry level office shorthand in the US required 60 or 80wpm; one person reports 120 to pass their program. Journalists in the UK needed 100wpm until fairly recently, and often considered shorthand their most difficult course. Current office shorthand requirement in other areas is 100-120. Toastmasters recommends 120 for formal speeches. Court reporting in California requires 200wpm for 10 minutes. https://www.courtreportersboard.ca.gov/applicants/skills_exam_faq.pdf

Note: Unless you get very good at shorthand, it is not advisable to use it for lecture notes. You will spend more time thinking about the shorthand than about the lecture. Then, after class, you will have to read the  shorthand (assuming it's readable) to learn the material. Learn the material in class. Use a combination of Rozane's system for Consecutive Interpretation and Cornell Notes to record what you need to remember, and what you need to research.

# Publications and Source Material

Most of these, and some contributions from the community, are available on (orthic.shorthand.fun) .

### Cursive, sometimes called Phonetic Cursive
A Manual of Cursive Shorthand,\
Hugh L Callendar, 1889.\
https://archive.org/details/manualofcursives00calliala/manualofcursives00calliala/page/n5/mode/2up \
This is included for historical reasons only. It was Callendar’s first shorthand publication. Much of the book is dedicated to a systematic condemnation of Pitman. Callendar was fluent in Pitman. He was also a Victorian gentleman, lawyer, and engineer. It's a fun read.

### The Manual
A Manual of Orthographic Shorthand: The Cambridge System, \
Hugh L Callendar, 1891.\
https://orthic.shorthand.fun/manual \
“Two and a half years’ experience in teaching Cursive has convinced me that the difficulties which beginners find in learning to spell correctly by sound are much greater than I had previously imagined; and that it is unadvisable to attempt to introduce a phonetic system of shorthand at an early stage in education.”

### The Supplement
Supplement to the Manual of Orthic Shorthand [Orthographic Cursive], \
Hugh L Callendar, 1982.\
https://orthic.shorthand.fun/supplement \
“It is now nearly a year since the publication of Orthographic Cursive. The approval with which it has been greeted on all sides has more than fulfilled the author’s expectations, and repaid him for the years which he has spent in the endeavour to devise a system of shorthand sufficiently simple for general use.”
…
“The object of the following pages is to supply fuller explanation and illustration of the methods of abbreviation given in the Manual as ‘Hints for the Reporting Style’ and to provide advanced writers of the system with additional matter for exercise and reading practice.”

### Teaching (Parts 1 and 2)
The Teaching of Orthic Shorthand: A series of lessons for the use of teachers and students of Orthographic shorthand (Callendar's system), \
W Stevens, 1896\
https://orthic.shorthand.fun/teaching-pt1 \
https://orthic.shorthand.fun/teaching-pt2 \
“The following lessons have been drawn up for the use of teachers in the “Orthic” system of shorthand.”
…
“If teachers and students will only follow these hints, and the lessons, as they are laid down, not hurrying, immediate success will accrue to their efforts.”

Part 1 covers the Manual in 9 lessons, and has links to practice material, and a few optional rules that are in neither the Manual nor the Supplement. Part 2 adds even more rules
Both the Manual and the Supplement ?? are needed to follow the lessons.

### Extended (Clarey)
Orthographic Cursive Shorthand (Orthic) ; The Cambridge System ; \
Hugh L Callendar ; \
Revised, Extended and Improved \
E Clarey, 1911 \
https://orthic.shorthand.fun/  under Resources\
This booklet is an update of the Manual, which merges (many) rules from the Supplement (and Teaching??), and adds a few more.

### Notes on the Reporting Style
Notes on the Reporting Style of Orthic Shorthand, given by W. Stevens in 'The Teaching of Orthic Shorthand' (1896) , \
Reddit u/uwula, 2015 (2019 - 4 = 2015)\
https://drive.google.com/file/d/14sBSBwjT76eqooWqHTABaRk_ar_MeOeF/view \
https://web.archive.org/web/20230611082516/https://old.reddit.com/r/shorthand/comments/ag2pq0/notes_on_the_reporting_style_of_orthic_shorthand/ 

“At the request of a couple of users here, I've put together some notes on W. Stevens's The Teaching of Orthic Shorthand.”
…
“Stevens occasionally overdoes things. There is a great deal to admire here, but there are many rough edges as well, and you should expect to do some fine-tuning if you want to use Orthic in a reporting style. All rules should be taken as suggestions. I will recommend against a couple of them along the way, though you may of course disagree with me.”

# Practice Schedule

Teaching recommends only 15 minutes a day in addition to the lesson (which I assume is weekly). A full hour would be better, but, like all mental/physical skills, a daily short session is better than a single long one.

[Swem](https://cricketb.wordpress.com/2020/02/12/systematic-speed-course-for-advanced-writers-swem/) recommends an hour a day, five days a week, with the first 15 minutes dedicated to a systematic review of the text, and the rest to one or perhaps two passages. He further recommends another two hour-long sessions a week, each divided into practicing new "phrases and expedients" from books, and "taking dictation from new material and reading it back."
