## Introduction

Most modern shorthand learners do not have the luxury of a teacher, or even a good self-instruction book (especially those of us who prefer obscure systems).

> This was supposed to be a short series of steps for students who wanted more guidance, based mostly on the the book Methods of Teaching Gregg Shorthand. (Leslie) Then I read more teacher handbooks, and a few studies comparing methods, (Bellows 1949; Pullis 1973) and entirely rewrote it, not because the Functional Method was wrong overall, but because some of its advice is extreme and may not work for all students, especially if it is taken out of context.  There is also a Bibliography. Yes, people really did write doctoral theses on shorthand instruction.{.aside}

When the evidence doesn't support one method over another, I describe the range and recommend either alternating or a middle path. I tried to identify which advice is supported by the majority of authors, or just a few, or just my own intuition, but sometimes forgot to do so.

Some exercises work on the skill you need. Some can be varied to work on different skills. Some exercises are more useful immediately after a speed jump. Others are more useful just before. I often recommend alternating exercises, or a series of exercises where each step works on a different skill.

In all cases, experiment! Look carefully at the results, and continue to experiment. You may not be ready for an exercise when I say to start it, and you may outgrow it sooner than expected. Then, months later, it might be exactly what you need.

Above all, enjoy!

How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. Shorthand is a whole herd of elephants.

Shorthand is like playing piano. After a bit of study, I knew the notes to play and when, and even what it should sound like, but I still can't read the notes fast enough to tell my fingers what to do. Even when I know what they should do, I can't make them do it.

Also like piano, shorter and more-frequent works better than longer and less-frequent. Of course long and frequent works even better. A variety of strategies to work on your specific problems will work better than simply playing the same piece over and over. All the advice about learning to play music can be applied to shorthand.

Reports on how long it takes to learn vary widely, even with the same system. Modern introductory books usually cover the theory in 90 lessons, including tests, asking for equal time at home as in class, and reach 60-80 words per minute (wpm) on practiced material but only 40-60 on new material. Those courses have teachers who can catch bad habits early and keep up the pressure, and don't count students who dropped out but could have passed if they had more time. Some books, especially Teach Yourself style, claim to go faster, but this might be marketing. One self-taught student took 220 hours to reach 100wpm. (Wentworth) It's complicated further by quality of book and teacher, and the system. Systems that are designed for high speeds usually take longer to learn and to reach intermediate speeds, but reach speeds that are impossible for simpler systems.

All popular systems can reach at least 120wpm. Slower systems were rarely purchased by schools, so did not become popular. > For comparison, longhand is typically 20-40wpm for longhand, typing 60-100wpm, UK Journalists (until recently) 100wpm, slow formal speech 100-120wpm, court reporting and closed captioning over 200wpm. {.aside}

> At the end of 90 periods, the student should be able to write approximately 60wpm on practiced material [...] write approximately 40wpm on new matter containing no principles beyond Chapter VI [half the theory]. (Gregg, Course of Study, Anni, 1930, p1)
> 
> ...at the end of the first 180 periods is 80wpm; and at the end of the course, 120wpm.  (Gregg, Course of Study, Anni, 1930, p1)
> 
> Each period is 40 minutes. Equal time at home. That's 180x40x2/60 = 240 hours to reach 80wpm.

A more recent [Reddit user reports](https://www.reddit.com/r/shorthand/comments/1l8ncr2/how_long_did_it_take_you_to_learn/) 80wpm after 1 year of high school to "ace the class" (get top marks), and a second year to reach 120 (again, to get top marks). Assuming 110 hours in class each year, equal time at home, that's 110x2x2=440 hours to reach 120 if you were a top student.

100 hours to reach 80 words a minute and "perfect ease in reading it" (2 hours/day at home, 6-8 weeks).

 I'd say that I spent about 100 hours over the past year. I can definitely write faster in Orthic but it is much slower than longhand to read. I still prefer writing to reading. I can read only about as fast as I can write (say 40-50 wpm).

It will take considerable effort beyond that.

Hadfield conducted a study to determine and compare the learning
achievement of students using the Gregg (DJ) symbol shorthand and two
abbreviated longhand systems--Forkner Shorthand and Stenoscript ABC
Shorthand--as measured by the dictation speed and standard vords correctly transcribed at the end of two semesters by eleventh and twelfthgrade high school students.
A total of nine public high schools were included in the study-­
three Iligh schools for each of the three shorthand systems. A language
achievement test was used to determine the student's ability level.
Hadfield concluded that the Forkner students achieved significantly
higher than the students using the Stenoscript or the Gregg systems.
The Forkner students in each ability level achieved higher than the students of corresponding levels in the Gregg and Stenoscript groups.
The Gregg and Stenoscript students achieved their highest
achievement in the 60-words-per-minute speed level while the Forkner
students achieved their highest achievement in the 80-\Vord-per-minute
speed level


Research reports indicate that after completing one year of short- 
hand instruction in high school, less than 20 percent of the students 
are capable of taking dictation at 60 words a minute. Even more ap- 
palling, the same reports show that after completing two years of 
shorthand instruction, less than 50 percent of the students are capable 
of taking dictation at 80 words a minute. (Pullis, Methods, 1973)



### Advice Varies

Advice in older books varies widely, often influenced by unproven theories, a desire to be different from other teachers, marketing, and how much time and money they were willing to invest in their book.

By 1950, methods of teaching shorthand was a popular thesis topic, with a variety of studies to see which methods work better. This continued until at least 1970 in the US, and probably still continues in countries where shorthand is still taught in schools (and student teachers of shorthand need dissertation subjects).

Some well-proven methods, and many studies, changed so many things at once that it is hard to say which advice was helpful, and which was unhelpful but overshadowed by the rest.

This course follows modern advice where it's clear, and shows the range of advice when it's not clear. Most modern books leave the advice vague. "Prepare the exercise for dictation. Your teacher will dictate it at a variety of speeds." They also assume you have enough practice material graded to each chapter to work on all the skills each week.

## Overview

Taking dictation involves several skills: Remembering familiar words, using the rules to build new words, making your pen write it accurately and quickly, and endurance. Working on only one skill at a time works better than working on several at the same time. Write a passage once to focus on theory, again to focus on penmanship, and again to focus on speed, choosing a speed suitable for each one. Experiment with changing the order. Sometimes doing speed before theory forces you to think faster, or even better, stop thinking and just write, but doing it too is more frustrating than helpful.

When you combine skills, you will need to slow down to compensate. Do this instead of sacrificing penmanship -- unless the exercise is intended to practice sacrificing penmanship in order to keep up.

Learning the rules so you can reduce preparation level is more important than speed. Dictation fast enough to make you focus and keep your pen moving smoothly forces your brain and hand to work without hesitation and highlights problem areas.

I use "easy, difficult, and impossible" instead of "comfortable" and "uncomfortable". With a bit of practice, you will become comfortable at impossible speeds!

This is not a pass/fail project. Do not test yourself. Instead, experiment to see if you're ready for the next stage.

Some exercises are more useful at different stages. Exercises which you outgrow may be useful again later. Continue to experiment.

There are three main ways to decide what to do next: Intuition, Rotation and Random. Those are described much later, see Progression, once you know the choices.

**Quickly Read** all the textbook, or at least several chapters helps you avoid beginner mistakes such as writing shapes incorrectly, or trying too hard to make the shapes exactly match the book, and writing material not in the book too soon -- all things usually caught by a good teacher. This is to see the shape of the elephants, not to eat them.

This step is controversial. Some students find it overwhelming, even when they remember that they will come back to eat the elephants one bite at a time. Do what works for you.

Do not write any word not in your book until you finish reading the theory.

**Read** at all stages, even after mastering the theory. Reading *well-written shorthand* shows you what words should look like. Reading your *own shorthand* will help you find mistakes before they become habits, and teach you what your own writing looks like. Reading *shorthand written by others* helps you learn how much your system can vary and remain legible, and what mistakes to avoid. 

This stage begins on the first day, and continues until you can read the book, your own writing, and writing by others, without hesitation.

**Copy** to train your hand and pen. Modern books start this on the first day. The Gregg Functional Method delays this a full 20 lessons. (Leslie says to either start immediately or wait the full 20 lessons. Intermediate delays are less effective. (Methods, p55))

This stage continues until you can write without hesitation, and your second writing of a passage is the same as the first. Even then, you may find copying new words helps you learn them better than simply reading them.

If your book doesn't have enough shorthand to copy, you will have to make your own. See A Note on Making Your Own Material, below, for advice on choosing material.

Start with short sentences and build up to longer passages. Repeat each passage until it is comfortable.

**Practice penmanship** every day by copying, slow to medium dictation of prepared material, and exercises. Choose exercises according to your ability.

**Prepare for dictation** depending on your ability and the exercise. This stage overlaps with copying. Modern books (1970 and later) recommend starting dictation of prepared material shortly after you start copying, and delaying dictation of unprepared material until you finish the theory.

Start half the passages by copying well-written shorthand (if you have it), and the other half by reading text and writing shorthand. Correct it carefully and copy it several times.

Use material graded to your text if possible. Otherwise, choose short passages with old words in new sentences, and progress to new words in new sentences.

At first, copy each passage several times before taking dictation. Then **reduce preparation** in stages. Reduce the number of copies, then only write new words, then, finally, take dictation on new material.

Modern books continue to practice the full passage at least once until finishing the theory and you can take dictation of practiced material at 40-60wpm. Older books vary widely on how quickly to reduce preparation. 

Continue to start half the passages by reading, since reading is an important skill.

When you can write from text reasonably well, add **one try** to the rotation. Prepare by reading the text and practicing only a few new words, or less. Take dictation once at a speed you expect to be almost perfect. Do not check it. Type it tomorrow or a week later.

You will need to reduce the speed of the first dictation to compensate for decreased preparation.

Do ***not*** write your own material at any speed until you finish reading all the theory. If your book says it is safe to write new material before finishing the theory, take that with a grain of salt. Later chapters might have better ways to write words you use often, and you'll have to unlearn the simpler methods.

Practice does not make perfect, but it does make permanent. Only copy and build speed on correct shorthand.

**Take dictation** of prepared material to increase **pen speed**.

This stage begins shortly after copying, and ends when you can take unprepared dictation as fast as you want to. (Swem recommends a taper, starting when you reach 125wpm, 95% accuracy on new material, and ending at 150wpm.)

Several sequences are given for repeating the same passage to build speed. The most effective sequence changes depending on your experience with each speed, so I recommend rotating through them.

This section also has two text-to-speech sites suitable for shorthand, ways to find pre-recorded dictation at different speeds, and how to adjust speed on other recordings. A friend who dictates as needed would be even better, but instructions to find one are vague at best.

zzz promises

It includes other suggestions for exercises in addition to dictation, to increase pen speed.

zzz promises


**Take dictation of unprepared material** to bring it all together. Modern books leave this until after finishing the theory. Some older teachers start it immediately after dictation of prepared material. All agree to start with short passages of old words in new sentences.

Half of your dictation of unprepared material will be **One Try**. Take it once, just slow enough to be mostly accurate, then type it the next day. After typing, you can use it for repetitive practice.

Add **One Try** dictation to the rotation. Take dictation only once, at the fastest speed you are likely to succeed at, then type it the next day. 

Modern books leave One Try dictation of unpreviewed until finishing the theory.

Do not use One Try notes for repetitive speed building until after you have typed them. Extra practice and familiarity with the material will defeat the purpose. After that, using them will save a few steps, which is useful at first, when your goal is to write practiced material faster, but not later when your goal is exposure to increase your shorthand vocabulary.

This stage ends when you have met your goal for speed and length.

**Build endurance** as the final step. Increasing the length reduces speed.

Modern books do very little endurance building before finishing the theory. Older teachers vary widely. All books agree, though, that you need to continue to work on short passages. It is impossible to build speed on long passages until you have speed on short ones.

The pyramid plan for increasing endurance is given, along with the reason behind it and a few other methods.
zzz promises

**Keep going** until you meet your goal.

## Diary

For much of the course, you will rotate through methods of preparing material for dictation, methods of repeating dictation of the passage at higher speeds, and length of passage. You will also rotate through experiments. Too many factors affect your progress to prepare a plan in advance.

Knowing what you did and how well you did it will help you decide what to do next.

Every time you write, record the speed, word count, and number of mistakes. *It doesn't have to be precise.* The numbers will change rapidly at first, then settle down, then be unsettled again when you increase difficulty.

Reading speed is as important as writing speed. Test it every few sessions.

Remember to look back at the first few pages to see how far you've come!

## Quickly Look Through the Book

Note that all systems have new shapes, new spellings, and new pronunciations. They all leave out letters and entire words that you can easily fill in later (with a bit of practice). Modern systems are usually easier to learn and will reach useful speeds faster than the more complicated systems intended for courtroom speeds, but even the simpler systems have scary bits. Trust the system.

If your book, or a supplement, has enough graded exercises, then follow it. It will guide you through increasing difficulty and duration, and may even give speed goals. The exercises and advice on this site will still be useful, as even the best books are limited. After finishing the book you follow the same routine as the other students. 

If your book is merely a description of the rules with a few examples, you will follow a repetitive routine of re-reading the theory a bit at a time, writing and then copying well-written shorthand and/or taking dictation at a variety of speeds, reading your own writing, and penmanship. The way you prepare for dictation and build speed changes as you master the theory and reach higher pen speeds.


zzz

This suggestion is controversial, since it can be overwhelming, but if you keep the purpose in mind it will prevent more problems than it causes.

Most mistakes made by new shorthand writers can be avoided by reading more of the book before writing.

They make lines longer than necessary, or squash circles, or write high above the line, not realizing that later chapters give other meanings to long lines, squashed circles, and raised outlines. Sometimes they do the opposite, and spend hours practicing shapes to a fraction of a millimeter.

Forkner says to leave out vowels, so *can* becomes `CN`, right? Several chapters later, they say that `C` means *can* and `CN` means *cannot*. All your old notes are wrong. For the next year, every time you try to write *can* you will hesitate. Every time you read notes from that time, you will wonder if `CN` means *can* incorrectly or *cannot* written correctly.

Orthic and Teeline quickly teach an acceptable way to write all words -- just use the alphabet, letter-by-letter. Your hand then has to break that habit as you learn simple ways to drastically reduce writing.

Modern books are organized to prevent those problems. Even so, you should quickly read about 1/4 to 1/2 before copying and all the theory before writing ungraded material. It's your choice whether to read the shorthand examples. It will be time well-spent, but isn't necessary for this purpose. If the book is divided into levels, continue past the "you can now write anything" statement, until you finish the first few sets of briefs or abbreviations. Faster ways to write common words are worth the extra time.

This first read can be overwhelming. Remember, you are not reading to learn the material, but to avoid beginner mistakes. You will see things that make you doubt the system, like leaving out information and lists of abbreviations to memorize. All systems have those, especially the faster ones.

> Switching systems will not help. (Cricket, personal experience.)


Note that all systems, even the simpler ones, simplify spelling and even leave out many sounded letters, which is scary at first. Trust the system. The main difference between phonetic systems often claim the write as you speak, but in fact write as the author speaks, complete with accent. Memorize the shorthand spelling of common words, like you did when learning to write English as a child. You will get plenty of practice for them. Use the spelling you think makes sense for the rest. I often use the standard English spelling for vowels, rather than think carefully about how I actually say them.







Trust the system. There is enough information in each outline to keep it readable. The abbreviations make sense. The missing words will be easy to fill in later.

> Some exception for unproven systems. Moat claimed that anyone who studied hard enough would have great success with his system, but his contribution to society was creating the system, not testing it. (Moat) It did not become popular, (Cricket), although it the system is "Simply better." (Sherman)

Many groups have a Quote of the Day, with multiple submissions and critiques. Reading those will help you avoid making the same mistakes, even if you don't yet know all the theory.

> Some systems have summaries as an appendix or separate document. Some have short books that teach the entire system quickly and another books with graded material. Some learners post summaries online to help others. Ask other writers of your system for information about ways to do this step faster.{.aside}

**Two Bookmark Method**

Optional.

One bookmark is to preview the theory and maybe trace the example words; it moves quickly. The goal of the first is to learn which details are important, as described above.

The other is for material you're actually studying; it moves slowly.

You can use yet another bookmark to read ahead, reading all the examples carefully but not writing them. It's a good way to fill time on the bus.

## Typical Hour While Learning Theory

A typical hour of study (after the quick reading) will be:

* 10 minutes reading your own writing (if you have it), ranging from yesterday to several months ago, even if your book does not say to do this. This will help you catch mistakes before they become habits, and help you learn how your writing differs from the text. Also read a variety of speeds from each time. Catch mistakes in fast writing before they become permanent. Practice reading hastily-written old notes.

* 45 minutes following the book: Reading theory; copying example words; copying, and taking dictation at various speeds. Details are below, and vary on how much material your book has to copy.

* 5 minutes penmanship practice, starting with exercise in the book. A variety of methods are described later. Note: Mindlessly writing the same shape over and over will not help.

Many of the steps serve double-duty. Use your own judgement.

If your book has an appendix or sequel, continue that pattern, otherwise continue to After Finishing the Theory.

By the time you finish a good book, you will know the rules fairly well. If not, don't worry about it. Future steps will review them.

You will rotate through several things at the same time.

* First Encounter: Start half the exercises by reading shorthand, and half by writing from text.

* Reduced Preparation: At first you will copy each passage several times before taking dictation. Then you will experiment with reducing the copies.

* Type of Speed Building Method: Pratt's, Leslie's One Minute Speed Forcing, One Try, and Swem's Systematic Speed Course. Some methods are more useful at different stages.

* Speed Experiments: Each method has several speeds you can experiment with, such as starting, second, top, and final. Only experiment with one for each passage. Some of the speeds will be the same for all methods. Others will be different.

  Only experiment with one speed for each passage. Note that your starting speed will drop as you reduce preparation.

That's a lot to keep track of. Use the diary. Rotate through them systematically or choose randomly (but watch for too much unbalance). Repeat a method or experiment once or twice if you think it will help, then try something else.

> Since drills with a single stated objective are more effective than drills with several objectives, we distinguish between accuracy-building and speed-buidling exercises for instructional purposes. (Lamb, p90)

## Learning the Theory

Modern books work on theory, reading, copying, and slow-to-medium speed dictation of short prepared material in each lesson, but only one skill at a time. They leave dictation of unprepared material and endurance until the next course, after you finish the theory.

Work through the book, one chapter at a time, following the advice below for reading, copying, dictation, and penmanship practice. Trust your book's ratio of theory/practice and the gradual increase in length. Be a bit suspicious of the speed goals. They might be pessimistic or optimistic.

Your goal at this stage is not to build speed, but to learn the rules and building blocks in a variety of settings, which is aided by a bit of speed.

Teachers vary on this. Some speed through the theory, not pushing speed until later. By mid-term their students can write anything slowly. Some spend more time each week building speed and work very slowly through the theory. The Micromolar approach writes at 100wpm from the very beginning, for 10s to start.

Split the difference. Take full advantage of the exercises in each chapter. Build each one to your current best speed, or maybe a tiny bit more, then move on. This will help you "automatize" the outlines so you write them without thought. Some books have speed goals for each exercise. If so, attempt to follow them, but remember there is no teacher complaining that you will lower the class average. Likewise, don't hold yourself to slower speeds if you can easily exceed them.

If your book doesn't have enough material in each chapter to reinforce the theory, don't worry. You will reinforce it later.

Some books say not to memorize the rules; just use them in a variety of words. This is an over-correction from teachers insisting students memorize the exact wording. This wastes class time, and makes students worry too much. I find the words of the rules useful when my hand hesitates and when discussing outlines online, but once I know what the letter group or word should look like (and similar words it should not look like) I just write it without thinking about the rules. There is no time to think!

If your book says to just read, then it's your choice whether to do that or start copying. An extra bookmark is useful. Place one bookmark where you are copying, and another where you are reading ahead while waiting for the kids to finish soccer practice.

> Many books have optional rules. Use the ones that make sense for you, but look at all of them before deciding. Sometime a short word spelled out is the brief form for an important longer word. Sometimes an archaic word is used so often in the practice material that you learn it without trying.{.aside}

If a rule causes repeated problems, practice a list of words that use that and related rules.
zzz reorganize

Some systems have more than one book. Ask other writers about the differences. Some have better descriptions or examples of the rules, or more reading material, or more brief forms, or go off in their own direction. Some have separate books for teachers. Some change some of the rules. Using two books at once can help, but it can also be confusing.

### Brief Forms

Only use the brief forms and phrases in the book. Students often try to create more, which increases hesitation and confusion, with no net benefit in speed.

Hesitation loses more speed than a few more strokes. See [Klein's Motion Picture Study](#motion-picture-study-by-klein) for evidence.

When you finish the theory, experiment with phrases that might be useful. *Gregg Shorthand Phrasebook* and *Phrases of Gregg Simplified* group phrases into families, which will be useful for all systems.

### Personal Reference Binder

Optional, but I found it worthwhile.

Make a small binder of reference material, and add to it as you learn. Make sections for:

* Theory, sorted by lesson  
* Theory, sorted by alphabet (Include cross-reference entries between normal and shorthand spelling, so you can use it for reading or writing.)  
* Vocabulary (Only include abbreviations, words that demonstrate a new rule, and words you expect to struggle with.)

Only write as much of the rule as you need for quick reference. Include page number. It will save time when you doubt your notes.

Update this book at the end of each homework session or every week – after your hand is comfortable with the new shapes. Sort the contents of each page in any order that makes sense to you. The order does not have to be perfect.

When a page is filled, rewrite it spread over two or more pages, to make room for more.  This copying will help you remember the rules. You will need shorter explanations and fewer examples for familiar rules each time. I wouldn't omit rules, though, since a list can help with the column method for reading difficult words.

### A Note on Word Lists

> For example, there are 66,210 running words and 6,406 different words in one elementary shorthand text. Thus, for every different one of the thousand commonest words that the learner wrote, he had to write five other different words. The writer who would take the entire book from dictation would have to write not only the 1,000 words of high frequency but would have to write 5,406 other different words. (Leslie, Methods, p197)

No matter how much practice you get, and how many words reach the stages of familiar and mastered, there will still be many thousands of words that you have to build from scratch. Practice writing a list of unrelated words will only help you write those words. Practice writing "oo" in a few well-chosen words will help you write all words with that sound.

That changes once you master the theory. Then every word you can write smoothly gives you more time for other words and lists of uncommon and even rare words become more useful. Even then, though, a list from aardvark to zumba probably won't be worth it. There are several lists like "the most common 1000 words in American English."

That is not to say word lists are never useful while learning:

* A well-chosen list helps you lock in a rule, or review all the rules in a short time.

* A list of abbreviations helps you practice them without distraction.  

* A list of names at the beginning of a meeting makes it easy to make temporary abbreviations.  

* A list of words that sound similar but have different meanings helps find ways to distinguish them. (Some systems call them Arbitrary Distinctions or Distinguishing Outlines. Others deny any such problems exist.)  

* A list in the back of your notebook can help you remember uncommon or difficult words, especially if you need them months later.

* A list can be a quick way to increase vocabulary, but your hold on these words still needs to be reinforced with use in sentences.

There are two ways to learn lists. As always, pros/cons to each method. Spaced repetition is easy to set up and will get through the words quickly. Simple sentences using the words, and mixing up the order, will help high speed recall but is more work to set up and do. Combining the two works even better.

**Spaced Repetition**

Each time you successfully remember a word, promote it to a longer review frequency. If you struggle with a word you previously mastered, demote it. 

Some people use a deck of cards, one card per word, longhand on one side and shorthand on the other. Record the date each time you remember the word, and sort cards according to the next review date.

Leitner Box is a famous system for managing repetition using cards. Apps such as Anki have virtual cards and keep track of which words should be repeated and how often. There might even be a shared deck for your system.

See the Accordion Fold Method (below) for my favourite method for practicing both reading and writing lists of words, which takes less time to set up than either of the above methods.

www.quertysteno.com has a randomize function, but it only works in one direction and has no way to check your work. I'm sure there's a way to use it and NotePad for spaced repetition.

### Accordion Fold Method for Word Lists

Write the longhand in one column and shorthand in the column beside it. Fold or cover the paper so you can only see the longhand. Write the shorthand in the next column, uncover the key, note the mistakes and practice as needed on another page. Adjust the paper so you can only see the shorthand column. Write the longhand in the next column and note the mistakes. (You can save time and paper by saying the longhand but not writing it. Say it out loud and point with your finger to avoid shortcuts.) Now repeat the process with only the words you didn’t get first try. Keep repeating, until you have gotten each word correct more often than you got it wrong, or you run out of time.

Copy all words with mistakes in the first column of a page with tomorrow’s date. You will work on them again then. Copy the words you always got correct to another page, marked with the date you want to review them.

Each time a word passes, double the time until the next review. If you get a word wrong, demote it all the way down to every day, and make it earn its way up again.

Just visualizing the outline, without writing the shorthand, works but is less effective.

## How to Read Shorthand

> Well, it was the most remarkable thing in the world, don't you know, because I got every bloomin', blawsted word of it; the only difficulty is, that I cawnt read it. I will leave it to any man that I got it, and my notes will show that I have it, but I simply cawnt read the bally stuff. (James, 1912)

I don't know if this gentleman's difficulty was in making correct notes (but not noticed because he never read them) or in reading his correctly-made notes.

Begin reading shorthand on the first day. Reading *well-written* shorthand shows you what the words should look like. Reading *your own* catches mistakes before they become permanent and teaches you how your writing degrades at speed. Reading *others* writing shows you how much leeway there is, and alerts you to common problems.

Begin copying either immediately or half-way through the theory. Wait until you finish the theory if your book is very short.

Continue reading other writers' shorthand as long as you can, and your own forever, so it doesn't drift.

Reading your own writing immediately will catch mistakes before they become habits. Letting it sit for a bit will help you see more mistakes. Letting it sit until you forget what it says will show things that, while they are technically correct, make your writing difficult to read, so you can fix them and/or learn what to expect.

Read material written at a variety of speeds. Learn how your writing degrades

Reading out loud and typing are better tests of the accuracy than reading silently, but less convenient.

Do not worry about deciphering difficult words at first. They will all be difficult! For now, seeing the building blocks in a variety of settings is more important than practice deciphering. Leslie (Methods) recommends you keep one finger on the shorthand and the other on the key, but other authors say that encourages students to rely on the key and not learn to decipher.

I suggest that when you can read 9/10 words reasonably well, try reading the entire sentence a second time before using the key. When you can read 19/20 words reasonably well, use the [Column Method for Reading](#column-method-for-reading).

> Experimental evidence indicates that the reading approach [just reading, no writing or copying] should be used either for approximately 20 class periods of extensive reading or should be used for only a few periods. There seem to be disadvantages to the use of an intermediate length of reading approach. (Leslie, Methods, p55)

For each new word, or old word that you forgot:

* Spell it in shorthand while watching your teacher write it on the board.
* Say the word.
* Spell it again while tracing it in the book. Tracing it will help you make the shape accurately. Writing on blank paper will not. (Trace it smoothly. Do not pause between letters even if hand and voice are a bit out of sync.)
* Say the word.
* Repeat these steps a few times. Leslie (Methods) recommends writing all new words on the blackboard and reviewing them in a random order several times during the lesson.

This process will help lock in the shapes of each letter and combination, and the outline of the entire word. Doing this out loud involves multiple senses, which enhances learning.

Reading out loud also encourages you to read with a natural rhythm, which gives you a sense of the sentence and makes reading easier, especially if you need to identify homonyms and add punctuation.

Do not do this for words you already know. Read those as a single unit. When reading or writing longhand, you see or say `h`. You don't see or say `down, up, curve across, down` unless you are still learning your letters. Likewise, you don't write or say `T-H-E`, you just think `the`.

Reread each passage until you can read it without referring to the key. You may end up memorizing it. Point to each word as you say it so your focus doesn't drift. Close your eyes, point to a word at random, and start reading there.

As you gain experience, look for letters that often occur together, and think of them as a single letter. Eg TR and SH instead of T-R and S-H.

At fist, when most words are new, if you don't have a key, print the page and write the words above the outlines to make a key. You may need to bounce around, doing common words first. Be aware that sometimes the a that feels wrong is actually right, and the real problem is a word you confidently got wrong.



> The common belief that words are read by shape is incorrect. It was the best theory for the available data, in 1886.
> 
> Eye movement studies of fluent readers of typed material show that our eyes do not move left-to-right. They jump around, not just within a word but also across several words. Let your eyes do the same when reading shorthand, then go back and read it one word at a time, if necessary one letter at a time, to be sure you read what was actually there.
>
> The Moving Window experiment in the same article is also interesting. Larger windows allow faster reading, up to about 15 letters. (Larson){.aside}

### Column Method for Reading

The column method works well if you suspect a penmanship issue, or are not sure which of several sounds or abbreviations are intended. It also works for checking if a proposed abbreviation has other possible interpretations.

Make one column for each letter. The first row is the letter in shorthand. The following rows are your best guess at what each letter might be, roughly ordered by probability, written in plain text. Then work through all the combinations by brute force.

You will have to adapt it a bit if combinations of letters create word parts.

You may want to make a chart of letters by shape, including prefixes and suffixes, so you can look them up quickly.

This method can also be used for entire words, if cannot read several words in a row, or suspect that a word you are confident in is the actual problem. (I've never done this, and reading other parts of the same passage might be more help, but it's an option.)

## How to Copy Shorthand

zzz needs reorganizing

> Approximately a week of slow copying and slow dictation until the last initial diffuse movements have disappeared or are under control [before working on speed]. (Leslie, Methods, p363)

Some teachers say copying shorthand is a waste of time. If you slowly copy the shapes, without thinking of the words, then it will be.

Copy, without taking dictation, until your hand is somewhat stable and you can write common words smoothly. Vary the speed, but spend most of your time writing quickly.

Modern books say to start dictation from prepared material within a few days of starting to copy, and to build a bit of speed early. After you are comfortable, time your writing. Try to reach 40-50wpm. Strangely enough, many shorthands are actually easier to write fast. Faster writing also prevents the habit of going too slowly. Going too quickly, however, creates other problems.

Older books vary about how long to copy, often determined by how much material they were willing to write and pay to have printed. Leslie, author of the Gregg Functional Method, found copying shorthand immediately or delaying for about 20 class periods (half the theory) worked best. An intermediate approach was less effective. (Leslie, Methods, p55)

Begin the session by warming up your hand, if you haven't already, by writing longhand for a few minutes. Use penmanship exercises from your system, or one similar, if you know of any.

The first time you write a word, say the letters as you write them -- but only the first time you write the word, and again when you need to remember how to write it. When you can, think of letter groups and entire syllables, not individual letters.

First read the entire passage as before. Then read a full sentence. Then read and remember a few words at a time and write them. Continue 

Your first few hours writing will be erratic, no matter how much well-written shorthand you read first. That is normal while your hand learns the new shapes. If your brain already knows hundreds of outlines, your hand will improve rapidly. If it does not, then your hand may not know what to do.

After you are used to copying shorthand, try [Pratt's Easy Intro to Dictations](https://www.reddit.com/r/shorthand/comments/1m1gsj5/i_thought_i_was_getting_the_hang_of_shorthand/), without a sound file. Start slow -- and relaxed! -- and build speed as your hand warms up.

If you do not have good shorthand to copy, you will have to make your own. Be extra careful checking it.

Alternate the methods used for your first copy:
* Copy from shorthand in the book, if there is any left.
* Read printed text and write shorthand. Check against shorthand in the book if possible.

Begin with short sentences, using [Pratt's Easy Intro to Dictation](https://www.reddit.com/r/shorthand/comments/1m1gsj5/i_thought_i_was_getting_the_hang_of_shorthand/), but without sound files. This will let you focus on a few words at a time.

Write the first copy carefully, then speed up. Think of the outline as a single unit, not a series of independent letters. This feels wrong. It's like learning math tables. You first build them by drawing grids of dots. Eventually you just know the answer.

Watch what your pen wants to do. Let the shapes change a bit, as long as it's still legible.

You can learn a lot about the best way to write by writing quickly. The way you write will change when you speed up, and again as you get used to longer passages. Shapes will blur a bit. Your hand will change position. You'll even sit differently. Sometimes a position that's better in the long run takes some muscle building and stretching.

Most of your writing should be as fast as you can without sacrificing legibility. See Penmanship, Accuracy, etc for details zzz ref

After a few of those, alternate with longer passages using the Four Column Method (below).

Be gentle with yourself. It may take a week or two for what Leslie calls the "initial diffuse movements" to settle down. This is a normal part of learning new movements. Repeat each piece no more than a dozen times. A rest, and some sleep, will do more good than excessive repetition.




When a word slows you down, practice it a few times, then practice it with the words around it. Often the word we think is the problem is only the messenger. The real problem is a few words earlier. Even if you accurately identify the problem, it helps to have be confident in the run-up to it, to avoid tension. Adding a few after reduces the pause to celebrate success.

### Four Column Method for Copying

This method combines reading well-written shorthand, writing, and reading your own writing into a single series. It works well at the copying stage, in the early stages of dictation when you should have well-written shorthand in front of you, when you cannot take dictation, and at all stages for penmanship practice. It also helps you build pen speed separate from theory speed.

It will not, however, help you build theory speed. I speak from experience. Only exercises that force you to think of outlines at speed will help theory speed.

Divide two pages into two columns each, so you can see all four columns at the same time. Copy the passage from the book into the first column. Go slowly enough to be accurate, but no slower. If you are creating your own material, write your first attempt in the first column and leave a wide margin or skip lines for corrections.

Check your work and make corrections. The 1st column needs to be accurate, since it will be the model for the others. (Accurate means legible and following the rules, not perfect penmanship.) Choose a few outlines you struggled with and copy them a few times, then a few more including a few words on either side.

I sometimes do the first column of several passages at once, so I only have to carry my notebook to the kids' soccer practice.  It looks very different after the break, and counts as reading old writing. At first, though, go to the next step immediately.

Copy from the first column to the second with a bit of speed. Then copy from the second column to the third, and the third to the forth. Check your work, make corrections, and practice difficult sections after each copy, so you are copying accurately.

The first copy should be slow enough to be accurate, but no slower. The second column should be faster, and the third fast enough that your shapes start to degrade. You will find that shorthand is easier to write neatly with a bit of speed.

Slow down just a bit for the fourth column, so you write fluidly and accurately. Your hand will remember this copy most. Too slow will teach slow writing. Too fast will teach inaccurate writing.

Write a bit slower at first, until your hand gets used to the shapes, and faster when you know how the shapes should look. Each speed will help with a different skill.

You can also do this in rows. Write the entire passage, skipping rows for later copies. Skipping 5 rows will give you 1 row for corrections, 3 for copies, and 1 for a visual gap or an extra copy. Test both methods and see which you prefer.

### Pratt's Facility Drills and Speed Up Pads

This is similar, but uses one-line sentences or word groups (about 10-15 words), lines instead of columns, and more copies. See the Reddit post and [Pratt's site] for more details.



## Penmanship, Legibility, Correctness and Perfection

See [Fast Dictation](#fast-dictation) for reasons to use faster dictation.

> Therefore, if word-list tests are to be used at all, the writer urges that only the transcript be scored or graded. A correct shorthand outline is one that is correctly transcribed. (Leslie, Methods, p209)

> See Pullis and Ianizzi, later in this section, for a response to Leslie's comment.

End each writing session, no matter how short, with accurate but not-slow writing. Music and driving teachers also recommend this. Your body remembers the first and final 15 parts of a lesson more than the middle.

Always write as neatly as you can at the time, but be willing to sacrifice neatness if needed to keep up. (Exception, of course, for exercises where the goal is to write neatly, with dictation so fast you can't quite keep up.)

> In what order should we develop speed, accuracy, endurance? There are really only two factors concerned, because there is no such factor in shorthand as endurance. Endurance is merely a part of speed.
> [...]
> There can be no question of the order in which to develop speed and accuracy. They must be developed *concurrently but not simultaneously*. It is an old error of the shorthand classroom to keep the learner trying to give the best combination of speed and accuracy on every writing. Each day the learner should *write most of the writings for speed only*, without regard to legibility. Each day the learner should write *some of the dictations for legibility only*, without regard for speed. The speed of those dictations should be moderate, so that the learner is free to devote all his attention to writing perfect shorthand notes. Thus it is important that the learner should seldom try to combine the two, yet should never go for a full class period without alternating the two. (Leslie, Methods, p186) (Emphasis by Cricket.)

Practice does not make Perfect, but it does make Permanent!

If someone else can read it, then it's *legible*, even if it isn't exactly the same shape as the book. Don't fight your hand on details that don't matter. If it uses the proper rules (brief forms, affixes), then it's also *correct*. I use *accurate* as a synonym for *correct*, and *perfect* for tidy and easy to read.

> In teaching shorthand we have given too little thought to the right posture and to the development of swift, effortless writing from the beginning. Many teachers place such emphasis on *slow*, careful writing that the *habit* of slow movement is fastened on the student. Afterwards, in the advanced work, the student finds it difficult, and sometimes impossible, to overcome the sluggish, painfully precise style thus acquired. (Gregg, 1921)

However, too little emphasis on accuracy can create other problems.

> Studies of immediate and deferred transcription found inaccurate notes led to inaccurate transcription. The effect was more significant more significant after a week delay. (Pullis, 1973, p11, reporting on a study by Iannizzi)
> 
> One study was of a 5 minute dictation at 80wpm. The students were partway through an advanced class, and this speed was well within their abilities. With immediate transcription, 1.25% of the words transcribed incorrectly. 4.45% of the outlines were written incorrectly, but those few outlines accounted for 67% of the transcription mistakes. For deferred transcription of the same writing, that ratio went up to 75%, for a total error rate of 1.95%.
> In a related study of second year students at 70wpm, the results were even more drastic. Total transcription mistakes were 4%, and fully half of them were from the 12% of the outlines which were incorrect.{.aside}

All the writers took the same dictation. Their final score was determined by accuracy of the transcript.

You will not know how much a shape can vary from the book until you finish the theory. Until then, aim for shapes that match the book in every detail, but don't obsess over it. After that, think about which parts of an outline are important, and which can safely degrade. Many arbitrary-seeming rules result in outlines that are still legible even if degraded by speed. Practice letting outlines degrade safely.

Swem and Leslie both worked for JR Gregg. Leslie recommends against tracing outlines at any stage, but Swem suggests tracing shorthand in the textbook using a dry pen. This will force you to notice subtle details, but isn't always an option and may not give much variety. It may also make you worry too much about insignificant details.

Some of that difference of opinion is due to different audiences. Leslie's students read entire paragraphs every day, and knew hundreds of outlines by sight before picking up their pens. Swem's students had already completed the theory using an older book with fewer examples.

As always, I recommend you build a toolbox of penmanship exercises and rotate through them. Trace well-written shorthand. Write blindfolded. Copy single words, groups of words, entire lines, and entire passages. Use exercises from your system and others with similar shapes. Invent more exercises and experiment! If an exercise seems unhelpful, set it aside for a while and come back to it.

Remember you will have more time to write accurately at lower speeds as you increase your barely-readable speed, but you also need to practice readable notes at speeds that allow it. Practice at a mix of speeds, and make the best notes you can for each.

### A Note on Repetition

Practice does not make Perfect, but it does make Permanent.

> Anything that is dull and uninteresting is of doubtful pedagogic value. Also, excessive repetition generally results in progressive deterioration of the outlines practiced. (Leslie, 1936)
zzz get page

Teachers used to recommend slow careful copying of the exact shapes in the book -- lines and lines of a single letter or word, often before you know which details are actually important, and repetitive copying of shorthand shapes without associating the outlines with words. This rarely does any good.

However, well-designed repetitive exercises are often the fastest way to correct penmanship problems.

> Unintelligent repetition practice should be avoided in assigning word lists for homework. Any given word list should be copied not more than three times. The student should be instructed to copy the entire list once and repeat the procedure twice, rather than make three copies of each outline before proceeding to the next. (Gregg, Course of Study, Anni, 1930, p19)

As you repeat something, your writing will improve, then plateau, then degrade. Stop just before it begins to degrade. If you're happy with most of the repeats, you're done with the word. If not, then breathe, shake out your hand to reset, and continue. When it degrades again, that's as far as you should push that bit for now. Work on a different section or a different exercise and return to it tomorrow. Our brains and bodies need sleep to consolidate new skills. (Some say a 10 minute break is enough. Experiment!)

Always have an intent when you practice, and ask if the exercise is meeting that intent. The overall goal is swift, effortless, legible writing. Your goal for the exercise might be to master a shape or group of shapes, or to see how a shape degrades at speed, or any of a dozen other goals.

*Avoid exercises that allow you to stop paying attention.*

Vary the speed. Slow helps precision. Speed helps fluency and reduces hesitation. You need both. Try faster -- uncomfortably fast -- and see how the outline degrades, but only as an experiment. Try writing just one outline several times, then as part of a memorized group. What changed? Which bit can you focus on that make the rest of the outline behave? Sometimes a word that works well at one speed will become a problem again when your overall speed increases. Repeat the procedure.

Medium speed will not help precision, but will help you increase the speed at which you can write precisely.

Try writing an outline over itself multiple times or in a connected row instead of writing it separately. It gives different feedback. Gregg uses ellipses and zigzags.

I'll save you one experiment. A row of a single letter rarely helps. Letters are affected by their neighbours.

Try writing entire words, either a row of the same word or as a group of similar and different problem words or as part of a sentence. Does one way work better or worse?

zzz add pic gregg pra bra bre series, elipse and zigzag

Try printing the book and using a dry pen over the shorthand. This is surprisingly effective, even though you don't see what you wrote. (You may need to change the print size.)

Try the opposite of any penmanship pointers. Gregg clearly states that circles between opposite curves go on the back of the first curve, but my hand relaxed more when I tried putting it inside the second. It's the same shape, but slightly different focus.

Our brains and bodies remember the first and final repeats more than the middle ones. They should be as fast as possible while remaining easy to read.

Remember to relax!

### Find the Size Your Hand Prefers

Writing too small will slow your writing, since you need to be more precise. Too large will be awkward for your hand and lead to loss of control. Aim for a comfortable, flowing size. There are a few Gregg articles about size, with samples from expert writers. One fits 500 words per page, another fits only 100. zzz find ref

To Start: Draw straight lines on paper, a full inch [2.5cm] apart, and write a few sentences in cursive and/or print at whatever size your hand likes. Then measure the height of several letters. Typically lowercase letters are 2-3mm and uppercase letters are twice that. If your longhand is larger than average, then your shorthand will probably also be larger than average, and vice versa. Adjust a bit if needed to keep the lengths distinct.

Use that size when you start writing. The small letters should be as small as you can write comfortably, probably the size of lowercase longhand or smaller (since they're less complex). Large should be as large as you can write comfortable, at least 3-4 times the size of small. Medium should be between that, probably the size of your longhand capitals.

[Image of Gregg Letter Family](https://greggshorthand.github.io/anunit04.html)  zzz host image on my site; also Orthic and Pitman maybe

I only learned about this test a few years ago, and tried it after decades of writing Gregg. I discovered my hand was happier, accuracy better, and speed faster, when my large letters were 8mm instead of 7.

Consistency is more important than exact lengths. All tall letters should be the same height. Using sizes your hand likes will make it easier to be consistent.

Repeat this test with shorthand every few sessions, at a different time in each session. Your hand will change when it's cold or tired, as it learns the shapes better, and as you build speed. Reduce the frequency of the test as your size becomes more consistent 

Experiment with skipping lines. Even if the size doesn’t change, it can give your hand a bit more freedom. Again, the results might change as your shorthand skill improves, possibly in an unexpected direction.

> The actual size of the characters may be varied according to circumstances, such as the goodness of the light and the writing materials. The minuteness of any kind of writing is limited by the size of the smallest characters. In Orthic the small size may be made as small as desired, and the small circle may be reduced to a dot, but it is best to make the small characters about one-twelfth of an inch long (2.1mm), and the large ones at least twice as big." — [Clarey Orthic Cursive Shorthand, Revised Extended and Improved, 1911, page 3.](https://orthic.shorthand.fun/) zzz ref

Graph paper can help you practice consistent sizes, especially for horizontal lines, but it can backfire and make you try to be too perfect. Use it for precision drills when needed, but not as a regular practice. Use an online generator to make paper that fits your size, or something like "small letters are 3/4 of a cell." 

Experiment!

## Writing From Dictation

> Dictation should be introduced by the use of practiced matter, without pressure for speed, accuracy, or legibility. From the beginning all dictation should be repetitive,but at first it is well to avoid the extreme pressure later associated with the 1-minute, repetitive dictation plan described in this chapter. Let the learner take his time. Do not watch his writing. Do not check his notes. Do not require him to read back. Give the learner time to get out of the stage of initial diffuse movements before applying pressure; the final results will be better. (Leslie, Methods, p169)

At least one other study says new matter dictation at a slow speed should begin early. (My notes are unclear. I think it was Pullis quoting Ward. Note to Self: Cross out research notes when they are no longer useful. Do not delete sections, especially the sections with the references.)

### Prepare Passage for Dictation

You now know how to copy shorthand and build a bit of speed while copying, and your hand is at least somewhat stable. It's time, finally!, to start dictation.

> How long a dictation? For the first few days the dictation may profitably be limited to 30-second readings. After a few days two 30-second readings may be combined into a 60-second reading. From that time on, in general, 60-second readings seem the optimum length, with an occasional 30-second reading to enable the learner to write at a higher rate than he can get on the 60-second readings and with an occasional reading of 2, 3, 4, or 5 minutes. (Leslie, Methods, p169)

Sources of recorded material, and how to make your own, are described later.

Material graded to your book is best, since it gives you time to consolidate a few rules at a time. Your brain and hand will have enough to do just repeating short sentences they already know at a speed forced by the dictation.

Begin with a single line, about 10 words. You may need to do only part of an exercise.

> *Forkner 2nd Edition* (Forkner, 1983) has two exercises in each chapter, one starting from text and the other from shorthand, with the answer in the back. The instructions for both, starting with the first chapter, are "prepare for dictation." *Teeline for Journalists* (Johnston, 2004) always starts by reading the shorthand. Neither book mentions cold dictation. Forkner's final dictation is 300 words long. Teeline's is only 200.

Copy the passage as before, until you can read and write it fluently, then **take dictation** at a very slow speed. Remember to alternate for the first writing, so half begin by reading shorthand and half begin from reading text.

### Reduce Preparation

> The goal toward which you are striving is to reach the point where you can take new matter at your top speed and write it as well as you would after taking it two or three times. Of course, no matter how much skill you may eventually acquire you will occasionally "flunk" an outline or a phrase. In reading it back you will correct it, but the fact that you wrote it incorrectly the first time should be no cause for worry. It is done by everybody. Your aim should be simply to bring these errors down to a minimum. (Swem)

As usual, teachers are inconsistent about when to reduce preparation. Leslie (Methods) recommends that students take dictation with the shorthand image in front of them, especially when they are new to dictation and trying to apply several new skills at the same time. All students – fast, slow or lazy – will reduce their reliance on the text as their confidence and speed increase.

Gradually reduce the number of copies. Do enough that you write smoothly and without hesitation, but don't waste time on more.

When you can write *new material from text smoothly, with 90% accuracy* (18/20), continue to alternate reading the shorthand or text, but only write new words, instead of the entire passage. This is called dictation from *previewed* as opposed to prepared material.

When you can write *new material from text with 95%* (19/20) accuracy, add a first writing from slow dictation to the rotation. This is called *cold* or *new material* dictation. Material keyed to the text (graded), using only the theory covered so far, still counts as new material.

I chose this range because several articles recommend previewing 10% of the words, and expecting 100% accuracy is unreasonable.

Now rotate through these for your first copy:
* Read the shorthand once before dictation, if available, for practice reading.
* Cold dictation with no preview.

> There is no rush. Pullis (p42) reports on three studies; 2 said early introduction of new material dictation neither helped nor harmed (presumably measured at the end of the course); 1 said it helped. zzz date of Pullis. Leslie (Functional, 1936; Methods, 1953) clearly says to leave unprepared dictation until finishing the theory, unless the school board insists otherwise. In that case, help your students practice for the test as needed, but most of their work should be building speed on practiced material. Forkner (1983) and Teeline (2004) leave it until theory is complete. (It's possible that the teacher's manual for either book includes graded material for cold dictation, but the student books don't mention it.){.aside}

All books recommend beginning unprepared dictation with short passages of old words in new sentences. Build success!



### Take Dictation

Your routine for many weeks or months, for this part of the hour, will be to prepare a passage and build speed on it using one of the following plans. Each dictation, keep most numbers the same and experiment with increasing one. 

Be gentle with yourself. Pushing speed too early creates more problems than it solves. Your writing will get better over the next week as you get used to the new procedure. After that, raise the bar to legible and correct.

It is ok to lag behind by a few words. This is called carrying, and is a useful skill. It lets you get a better sense of the words before writing, and helps you stay on track when the speaker speeds up for a short time. Advice varies between 5 words and half a sentence. Some teachers do not let students start writing until a few words in, to train carrying ability, sometimes as high as 20 words. Experiment, but remember that is a separate skill.

I recommend three methods to build speed: Pratt's Easy Intro to Dictation; Leslie's One Minute Speed Forcing Plan; Swem's Systematic Speed Course. Use a different one for each passage. Details of each are below. Other methods, which might be fun to experiment with but I suspect are a bit too extreme for regular use, are under [Other Bits and Further Reading](#other-bits-and-further-reading).

You may find one method works better for short passages, and one for longer. You may find one method works better as you're just about to make a speed jump, and another works better just after. Experiment!

As with copying, read your work carefully and practice difficult areas after each take.

Regardless of which speed building plan you use, half your dictation time should be spent, not building speed, but reinforcing it with **One Try dictation**, described earlier. You can reuse those passages for prepared dictation.

If you have problems at slow speeds, it's because either you don't know the theory well enough, or you are letting a few difficult words throw you. In the first case, do more preparation. There is no benefit to unprepared dictation before you know the theory to support it. In the second, increase your speed even more. Force your pen to keep up with the easy bits, and identify which bits need more work.

### Pratt's Easy Intro to Dictation

Pratt's Easy Intro to Dictation gets you started. It is a variation of her Facility Drills that works on pen speed, not theory speed. Your brain and pen will have enough to do trying to keep up. It is also useful whenever you need to build speed on a tricky bit, practice new vocabulary, warm up your pen, or simply convince yourself that your pen can move that fast.

**Numbers to Note:** First dictation. Final dictation. Keep notes of these. Each time you use this method, experiment with increasing only one number.

This method repeats the same passage multiple times in the same file, at the same speed.

Start with a passage in the text, about 10 words long. Even the thinnest books have at least some. Prepare it as described earlier.

Then use [Pratt's Easy Intro to Dictation](https://www.reddit.com/r/shorthand/comments/1m1gsj5/i_thought_i_was_getting_the_hang_of_shorthand/).

Start dictation at 20wpm. This is painfully slow until you try taking dictation to it!

Your first few tries from dictation will be terrible, even if you wrote very well without the pressure of dictation. Try this speed a few times, pausing briefly after every few tries to practice the worst bits. When you stop improving (no more than 5 tries), raise the speed to 30wpm and try again. See how high you can go. Remember, your goal is the correct shapes made swiftly, effortlessly and legibly, not textbook-perfect penmanship.

Repeat for a few short passages. Stay with slow, comfortable dictation while you get used to the process and your nerves settle.

Treat all increases as experiments, not tests. Sometimes we're not ready. Other times we need to bash our heads against the next level a few times before achieving it.

Don't worry too much about choosing the perfect speed. Dye (1974) compared students who practiced 0-20wpm above the speed for an upcoming test (3 minutes) with those who practiced 20-40wpm above that speed. Both groups used "a repetitive dictation plan, with each step of the dictation being approximately one minute in length." The groups showed little difference on the test, but the author also notes that the higher speeds "seem to be favourable to the learning of shorthand." He did find, however, that reasonable expectations affected student attitude, which in turn affected their performance. Therefore, when you are challenging yourself with higher speeds, be aware you are doing so.

### Leslie's One Minute Speed Forcing Plan

I recommend speeds that allow 95% accuracy, maybe 90% for the highest, and 98% for the final mid-speed take. Leslie thinks it should be higher.

If your first attempt is <95% accurate, work on the problem areas and try again. There is no benefit to increasing speed of incorrect outlines.

This method begins with a speed you know you can achieve, builds it in steps until you overshoot your ability, then lowers for an accurate final take at a middle speed.
 
Link zzz to full text, Leslie   Full text of Lamb's version of Leslie's One Minute Speed Forcing Plan is attached. zzz ref

> Leslie (Methods, 1953, p174) and Lamb (1961, p88) describe similar plans. (Lamb may have described it in her 1953 edition, but I cannot find an easily-accessible copy of it. Blanchford (1940) describes the second part of the plan, but not the first. If you know who should get credit, please let me know!){.aside}

Combine Leslie's and Pratt's method at first: Use a 10-word passage repeated to fill a minute for each speed.
  
| Passage Length in Words | Speed in WPM | Number of Repeats of 10-Word Sentence in 1 Minute |
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
| 10 | 20 | 2 |
| 10 | 30 | 3 |
| 10 | 40 | 4 |

Start at 20wpm. Try it a few times without a break, then practice the worst bits for no more than 15 seconds and try again. Take dictation at 30wpm for 1 minute. Again, practice the worst bits for no more than 15 seconds. Continue raising the speed and quickly working on difficult areas until your notes are not quite legible. Then drop to the second or third speed -- one which you struggled but achieved -- for the final take. This time your notes should be very good.

Typical patterns are: 20,30,40,50,30, and 20,30,40,50,40.

> Leslie and Lamb recommend that, when the speaker speeds up, they keep reading to fill the minute. This will prevent anticipation of the last word. Pre-recorded dictations just let the dictation get shorter. If you want to do it the first way, measure the length of the countdown in the recordings or your dictation program. Set a timer for 1 minute, plus the length of the countdown, plus 5 seconds. Start the timer. When it shows 5 seconds, start the recording or program. The countdown will finish when the timer has 1 minute left. I don't think it's worth the extra complexity, but it might be useful if you start anticipating the end of the passage.{.aside}

The entire cycle will take 4-6 steps. Vary according to the difficulty of the passage, the day, and how close you are to a breakthrough. Leslie gives as examples: 60,75,90,100,75. 60,70,80,90,100,70. 60,80,100,120,80. Lamb gives 60,75,90,75. 

This pattern allows you to "write about 20% of dictation under ideal conditions for perfect formation of the outlines," as recommended by Leslie. (p363)

**Numbers to Note:** First speed. Overshoot speed. Final speed. Length. Keep notes of these. Each time you use this method, experiment with increasing only one number.

When you can meet a challenge most of the time, that is your new number. Change nothing else for at least one passage to lock it in. You will be able to push some passages higher. Do so! A few passages just won't cooperate. Do your best, then move on.

* Starting speed. 10-20wpm steps are typical, but advice varies. Your starting speed will drop as you reduce preparation, but the other speed will stay the same.

* Final speed. Again, 10wpm steps are typical.

* Highest speed. Again, 10wpm steps are typical. Leslie recommends it be the speed at which you are only 80% accurate, but you should work up to it over a few weeks. See [Fast Dictation](#fast-dictation) for advice on going even faster.

* Length. Increase the length of the phrase and reduce repetitions, so that the passage takes 1 minute at the final speed, but no more. Try 5-10 word steps. See [Building Endurance](#building-endurance) for details on when and how to start increasing the length again.


### Swem's Systematic Speed Course for Advanced Writers

[Swem's Systematic Course for Advanced Writers](Crickets-Shorthand-Site/swem-systematic-speed-course.md) starts with a speed you can barely achieve, makes corrections, slows to practically perfect, then builds again to meet or exceed the initial attempt. This method is very useful if the passage appropriately prepared for your skill level, but more frustrating than useful otherwise. Experiment!

Swem says to start it when you can write at 80wpm for 5 minutes on unprepared material, but I used it successfully much earlier than that. He recommends changing the procedure once you reach 125wpm on new material with at least 95% accuracy.

**Numbers to Note:** First speed. Practically Perfect speed. Final speed. Length. Keep notes of these. Each time you use this method, experiment with increasing only one number.

* Starting speed. 

> It will be hard at first – taking a new article and writing it at a speed at which you must exert yourself – but write it that first time as if your life depended on it. Acquire the habit of “getting it” the first time. Never mind your notes (just so they are kept within reasonable bounds) and do not bother about phrasing or anything else. Just get it down some way or another. (Swem)

  Make corrections. Swem is emphatic on this. Always read your first dictation of a new passage carefully.

* Practically perfect speed. This is similar to but not the same as your starting speed for the One Minute Speed Forcing Plan, due to different levels of preparation.

* Final speed. Take it several more times, increasing the speed each time until you reach the first speed, higher if you can do so and keep it correct. You will write it four or more times in total.

Once you are comfortable Swem's method, add an extremely fast starting speed to the rotation, described under [Fast Dictation](#fast-dictation). 

### One Try Dictation and Transcription

Modern books leave this until after finishing theory. Older books vary. Many use a middle ground: one try dictation using theory learned 2-6 weeks earlier. (Remember these are school books, so one week is several lessons and associated homework.) They all agree to start with short, easy material.

Take dictation as fast as you can with minimal mistakes, but do not check it, Type it the next day. This is a better test of your skill than immediate transcription. Typing is more effective than reading out loud. After typing, check it against the key to catch mistakes before they become habits.

> [Students should have the] opportunity to write about 20 per cent of the dictation under ideal conditions for perfect formation of the outlines. (Leslie, Methods, p363)

You can use the same passage for repetitive speed building after transcribing it.

Choose a speed that allows 95% accuracy on the transcription. This gives you a bit of leeway on the accuracy of the dictation, but only if your spelling and punctuation is good enough to compensate. These also count as reading your own medium-aged, medium-speed writing.

Occasionally experiment with a faster speed to see of you can do it, and an [impossibly fast speed.](#fast-dictation)

**Numbers to Note**

* Speed.
* Days between dictation and transcription.
* Accuracy of transcription. Maybe ease of transcription.

### Fast Dictation

See [Penmanship](#penmanship-legibility-correctness-and-perfection) for reasons to use slower dictation.

> It is true, however, that if a learner is permitted to stay at 60 words a minute until he can pass tests with 1-5 errors consistently, his progress is being harmed. He becomes so accustomed to writing at that speed that he finds difficulty in going up to 80 words a minute. If he is started up toward 80 as soon as he can write 60 within 10—20 errors, it is much easier to make the transition to the higher speed. This is true at each speed-step on the ladder. (Leslie, Methods, p87)

What should you do if you can't keep up?

> Acquire the habit of “getting it” the first time. Never mind your notes (just so they are kept within reasonable bounds) and do not bother about phrasing or anything else. Just get it down some way or another. (Swem)

> Not all the learners may get this fourth dictation, but urge them to keep on and write as much of it as they can get consecutively. They are not to drop a few words and then resume writing. (Leslie, Methods, p174)

> When writing for speed the learner should accustom himself to writing at whatever speed is necessary to get the dictation, even though this may result in absolute illegibility for the moment. When the dictation is within his speed he should be careful to take advantage of all the time available for writing the most perfect notes possible. Part of the training should be to teach the learner to write as fast he must and as slow as he can; to write as fast as the dictation requires and as slow as the dictation permits. (Leslie, Methods, p186)

Leslie's speed forcing plan described above has practice at a variety of speeds. Very convenient!

Pratt supports that method, and **adds another option**: Finish writing what you can, then pause until the speaker starts a new sentence. Instead of one long and impossible passage, it becomes a series of short fast passages.

> Such an exercise must be done with that specific purpose in mind from the outset, and with a firm will, and not used as a fall-back excuse for constantly missing out chunks in other dictations."\
-- [Pratt, Dictation](https://www.long-live-pitmans-shorthand.org.uk/dictation.htm)

### Sound Recordings and Text Reader (aka Dictation) Programs

First, a quick note on pacing.

> Uneven dictation is more difficult to write than even dictation. Therefore when the learner is still in the practice stage, he should be given even dictation. Just before he is ready to go into the business office he should be given the office-style dictation already described in this chapter. (Leslie, Methods, p188)

> Natural speech is a bit uneven. Short phrases and small pauses help. Extreme ones, such as thinking about what to say next, do not. (Cricket)

#### Natural Speech

If your book comes with recordings, use them.

Pratt explains how to make your own recordings on her site, [Long Live Pitman's Shorthand](https://www.long-live-pitmans-shorthand.org.uk/). This gives natural sounding text at a variety of speeds.

Many sites, including YouTube, Let's Love Teeline Together, and Long Live Pitman's Shorthand, have recordings for dictation at various speeds. Most players let you adjust playback speed. They probably aren't keyed to your text, so you should wait until you finish learning the theory before using them. Many have a systematic review of theory. See Making Your Own Material, below.

Text reader apps let you paste the text, set the speed, and click Start. It sounds unnatural, especially at slow speeds, and a bit harder since words are at a constant pace instead of grouped grammatically (older software), but takes less time to prepare.


#### Text Readers and Apps

Most text reader programs (aka test to speech) are too fast for early dictation, or are not properly calibrated. These are pretty good:

* [qwertysteno.com](http://qwertysteno.com/Dictation/)  
This site lets you save text files, which is nice if you prepare on the computer then take your phone to the kitchen table for dictation. It will also randomize a list of words or lines. It has a countdown before dictation so you can set the phone down and pick up your pen.

* [www.naturalreaders.com/online](https://www.naturalreaders.com/online/)  
This one is reported to sound better, and may do other languages. Its slowest is 50wpm, which is a bit fast for new writers. It doesn't have a count-down, but you can add one to the text easily enough.

## A Note on Making Your Own Material

Regardless of your book, only use material from it until you finish the basic theory, to avoid conflicts with later rules. Do not add your own rules until you finish at least the intermediate theory, unless the book tells you otherwise. (Some books tell you to make your own abbreviations, but then continue to add official ones that conflict with the ones you made. This is annoying.)

Some books separate those nicely. Some mix them together. If you aren’t sure where the core theory stops and optional theory begins, read more of the book, not to learn, but to see which sections are core theory, which are optional but useful, and which should wait.

See Quickly Look Through The Book, above, for other examples.

Modern books usually have enough exercises that you do not have to make your own material until you know the basic theory well. Luxury!

The key from a book for another system is a good way to systematically practice the rules. It will have a chapter to practice prefixes, another for suffixes, another for common words, and probably another for common phrases.

Older books used popular books of the time, which explains why Shelton's (1710) includes brief forms for Genesis through Revelations. Stevens, teacher of Orthic, says he chose the Bible because everyone had a key.


## Typical hour After Finishing Theory

A typical hour after finishing a less-good book, or after finishing a good book but before mastering the theory will be:

* 10 minutes reading your own writing as before.

* 15 minutes rereading the text and copying the examples. This also warms up your hand. Continue this review until you reach 125wpm for five minute on unseen material. (Swem)

* 15 minutes copying and/or writing from dictation. Use a combination of Pratt's Easy Intro to Dictation, Leslie's One Minute Speed Forcing Plan, and Swem's Systematic Speed Course for Advanced Writers, depending on your stage of theory, brain speed and pen speed.

* 15 minutes One Try dictation. Write from slow dictation with minimal mistakes.

* 5 minutes penmanship practice to end every writing session.

The exact ratio of One Try to repetitive will shift. Start with One Try for only 20% of your writing time. Use the above ratio for 

xxxx

As before, many of the steps do double-duty. Use that to your advantage.

If you use shorter sessions, do one or two types of work each session, for the same ratios each hour. Always end with a bit of precision practice.

On days you cannot follow this program, or need a change, try other exercises. Clearly state your intention for each exercise. (Seeing what it feels like, and making productive use of a bus ride or long meeting, are valid answers.)

## Reviewing The Theory

Review the theory and copy the material that demonstrates each rule. You will work through the book several times.

Material that includes a systematic review of the theory might count towards some of the theory review time. Use your own judgement. Often rereading the original text, with a full explanation of the rules, reminds of details we forgot or never actually learned.

Once you have mastered the basic theory, you can alternate the basic rule book with advanced theory.

Swem recommends this practice until you reach 125wpm for 5 minutes on unseen material. You will work through the book several times.

At first, your goal is to use each building block, and blocks of blocks, in a wide variety of settings, not to increase your shorthand vocabulary. When you have a full command of the theory, and can build any word on the fly without hesitation, it is time to start increasing your vocabulary. Start with lists of the 1000 most common words, then 3000 most common, etc. Also look for lists of word in your profession. Don't spend time on words you will need rarely; you can build those on the fly. When you're ready for the unabridged dictionary, make a plan to avoid spending weeks on AB words. ZY words are equally important!

## Building Endurance

> Thus the writer already cited could write 100 words a minute for 5 minutes and 120 words a minute for 2 or 3 minutes. When that writer can write 140 words a minute for 2 or 3 minutes, he will be able to write 120 words a minute for 5 minutes (by the skin of his teeth); but he will be able to write 100 words a minute for 7 or 8 minutes very comfortably. (Leslie, Methods, p309)

> A thoughtful consideration of the implications of the statements made at the beginning of this article will make clear to the teacher why a student will most rapidly gain speed and so-called “endurance” on 5-minute takes by practicing 1-minute takes. (Leslie, Methods, p310)

Modern books increase speed and duration while you learn the theory. Each chapter has a variety of lengths, always including 1-minute, and the longest one increases slightly every few chapters. Forkner's (1983) final dictation is 300 words. Teeline's (2004) is only 200.

Older books vary. Some wait until finishing the theory, then introduce it rapidly. Several authors recommend the pyramid method as described below.

If your book has material in each chapter, then keep it simple -- follow the plan in the book. Build each passage to your best speed for that passage. Some will be higher than others. Start shorter passages a bit faster to save unnecessary repeats. If you still need to build endurance after finishing the book, use one of the methods below.

If a passage is significantly longer, use a pyramid plan for it.

If your book does not have enough material in each chapter, I recommend leaving most of the endurance training until you finish the theory and preparation is down to reading the text and practicing new words, or even less. It's simpler.

Once you start building endurance, I recommend:

* Four 1-minute passages using the mix of preparation and experiments described earlier.

* Combine all four using the pyramid method.

* One 2-minute passage. Prepare it a bit better than usual, to compensate for the longer time. After a few of these, experiment with reducing preparation and higher speeds, as for 1-minute passages.

When you can write a 2-minute passage (without building up to it) only 10wpm slower than a 1-minute passage, at the same level of preparation and accuracy, begin increasing the length. Modern books increase slowly, but I think it's ok to take larger steps, as long as you adjust your expectations as you increase difficulty.

When you can write a 4-minute passage only (without building up to it) only 20wpm slower, drop the pyramid plan. The new ratio is four 1-minute passages and one 4-minute passage.

Return to the pyramid plan for a short time if needed after increasing the your 1-minute speed.

That's a lot of different numbers to change! Record experiments and results. Rotate through them, or roll dice to decide what to try next. Repeat the same numbers once or twice when you go up a level.

> Increase in speed should always be followed up by increase in accuracy and sustained power at the lower level. (Lamb, p90)

### Pratt's Easy Intro to Duration Training

[This method](https://www.reddit.com/r/shorthand/comments/1m1gsj5/i_thought_i_was_getting_the_hang_of_shorthand/) builds hand endurance without stressing brain endurance. As always, work one skill at a time! Pratt also explains why longer dictations are more difficult.

### Pyramid Method

This method is especially useful if your long-dictation speed lags too far behind your 1-minute speed.

> A student can write new matter for at least a half-minute at a speed 20wpm faster than he can for 5 minutes. Also, he can write new matter for 2 minutes at a speed of at least 10 wpm faster than he can for 5 minutes. (Blanchard)

Blanchard, Leslie (1953, p174), Pullis (p54), and Lamb (p87) all show variations of speed pyramids based on this fact. 

Length is calculated from your 1-minute final speed.

Build a 1-minute passage to speed as usual. The do the same with a second passage. Don't experiment with speeds on your first pyramid. Just use speeds that work. Resume experimenting with your second pyramid. (You can use passages you've already brought up to speed, but maybe do them one more time to be sure they're still at speed.)

Combine them into a single passage and drop the speed by 10wpm. This will take longer than 2 minutes, but not much.

Blanchard includes a step before this: Divide each minute into half, and dictate them one after the other, at the 1-minute speed, pausing a few seconds between. Leslie and Lamb think that's unnecessary: 

Repeat with another pair of 1-minute passages.

You can stop here, or go to the next step: Combine those two passages and drop speed another 10wpm.

> Alternate Math, starting with desired 5-minute speed. Eg You want to write for 5 minutes at 80wpm. That's 400 words. The quarters are 100 words at 100wpm, so 1-minute each. The halves are 200 at 90wpm, for 2.22 minutes (2m13s). The whole is 400 at 80, for 5 minutes.{.aside}



### Nine Questions About Dictation

Summarized from Leslie (Methods, p168)

* When to introduce dictation? The first shorthand writing, and all shorthand writing done in the shorthand classroom, should be from dictation.

* How to introduce dictation? Dictation should be introduced by the use of practiced matter, without pressure for speed, accuracy, or legibility. From the beginning all dictation should be repetitive, but at first it is well to avoid the extreme pressure later associated with the 1-minute, repetitive dictation plan described in this chapter.

* How long a dictation? For the first few days the dictation may profitably be limited to 30-second readings. After a few days two 30-second readings may be combined into a 60-second reading. From that time on, in general, 60-second readings seem the optimum length, with an occasional 30-second reading to enable the learner to write at a higher rate than he can get on the 60-second readings and with an occasional reading of 2, 3, 4, or 5 minutes.

* When to introduce new matter dictation? The learner is not prepared to begin new-matter dictation until he can write practiced matter at the rate of 80 to 100 words a minute on 60-second repetitive dictations. 

* How to introduce new matter dictation? The easiest material that can be found should be used for this purpose. A thorough preview should be placed on the blackboard and read rapidly and repetitively by the class as the teacher points to the outlines. Start with a few 30-second dictations, given at a speed well within the ability of the class so that everyone will be agreeably surprised to find how easy new-matter dictation is.

* What kind of material for new matter? Continue to give the learner the easiest material that can be found until he writes the terminal speed required. Then begin to give him more difficult material. 

* Where to get good speed-development material? Books from my publisher.

* What is the difference between dictation for speed development and dictation for mailable transcript? Dictation for speed development should be beyond the learner’s writing speed, to compel him to think the shorthand outlines faster. Dictation for mailable transcripts must be within the learner’s speed, or he cannot hope to make a mailable transcript. Mailable transcription is not a shorthand speed exercise; it is an exercise in translating readable shorthand notes into the conventions of written English—correct spelling, correct punctuation, and correct typing style. A common error is to compromise between the two and dictate the material too slow for good speed development practice but too fast for mailable transcription.

  Dictation for speed development should be given repetitively at constantly increasing speeds. Dictation for mailable transcription should be given only once, with the understanding that the learner has only the one chance to get it.

  (Leslie's Mailable transcript is the same as Cricket's One Try.)

* How much time should be given to dictation in one period? Every possible minute should be given to dictation.

  (He goes on to say that in a 40-minute class after theory is complete, 10 minutes should be mailable transcript, 15 minutes speed development, and 15 on reading back typed transcripts and remedial English.)

Beryl's site, differences
- angle of the paper -- works if you pull the pen towards your hand for the downstroke. Experiment, so most strokes in your system are at a good angle for your writing style. Pitman's strokes mostly go up-right, right, down-right and down. Gregg's strokes do all that, but the downstroke goes slightly left, similar to downstrokes in cursive. Experiment!

- exams, corrections in the margin. I agree with Pratt that they're a very good idea in most situations, but suspect that some exams consider even margin notes to be "added after the fact." Check the rules for your exam and practice following them.

- speed before endurance. Leslie's One Minute Speed Forcing Plan has an example of starting starting with 1 minute at 60wpm, barely legible, and ending with 400 words at 80wpm. That's more than enough speed and endurance until you finish the theory.

### Lamb's book
iunclude link to it

Lamb has much good advice for learning shorthand, along with chapters about classroom setup and other things a new teacher should consider, and ways different teachers are using the new technology of recorded audiotape. It's well-worth reading. Of special note, 


### Lamb's version of Leslie's One mInute


speed building, pyramid plan vs minute plan
p54

pyramid plan -- his starts with long slow , 80wpm
The Pyramid Plan 
The pyramid plan is designed to have students writing in "speed 
spurts" at a rate 40 words a minute beyond their 3- or 5-minute 
writing rate for one-half minute durations, with the objective being 
to raise the dictation recording speed by 20 words a minute on the 
combined series of one-half minute writings. 
Assuming that the writing level of the class were 80 words a 
minute, the pyramid plan would be administered as follows: 
Cycle I 
Step 1 Preview the unusual or difficult words on the chalkboard. 
(Preview words should be written rapidly yet easily on 
the chalkboard to stress fluency of writing. Words should 
not be placed on the chalkboard before the class begins.) 
Step 2 
Dictate the entire take of 400 words at 80 words a minute, 
the current writing speed of the class. (This dictation 
interval is based upon the assumption that dictation takes 
of 5 minutes are being used for evaluation purposes. If 
3-minute takes were utilized, the introductory dictation 
need be for only 3 minutes.) 
Step 3 
Have a small portion of the dictation read back by two 
or three students. Postview the chalkboard words and 
preview additional words as needed. 
Cycle II 
Step 4 
Dictate four half-minute takes at 120 words a minute. 
Have part of the material read back. (Provide for a ten- 
to fifteen-second rest pause between half-minute dicta- 
tions. Students might request additional preview of diffi- 
cult words during this period. In drill, students should 
never write outlines without knowing the correct con- 
struction of the outline.) 

4x.5x120 = 240 of the 400 words


Step 5 
Repeat Step 4 over the same material. (The first 240 
words will now have been dictated once at 80 words a 
minute and twice at 120 words a minute.) 
54 
Step 6 
Redictate the four half-minute takes at 110 words a minute 
without pausing and have part of this dictation read back. 
Cycle III 
Step 7 Repeat Steps 4 and 5, dictating two series of four one- 
half minute takes at 120 words a minute from the last 
half of the dictation material. 
Step 8 
Redictate these four half-minute takes at 110 words a min- 
ute without pausing and have part of the take read back. 
Cycle IV 
Step 9 
Redictate the entire take at 100 words a minute without 
pausing. Have part of the material read aloud in class. 
Step nine completes the pyramid plan with the students writing 
continuous dictation at an increased rate of 20 words a minute the 
goal for which they were striving.

zzz get images? or type?



### Flood's Speedbuilding Plan, Lamb, p88

He doesn't give a length. Practice at home each night.\
First day: Dictate at 40, 60, 80, 40.\
Second day: Dictate at 60, 80, 100, 60.\
Third day: Dictate at 80, 100, 120, 80.\
Fourth day: Dictate at 100, 120, 140, 100.\
Fifth day: Start at 120 and build up to 160. Then drop back to 120 or even 100. Call attention of the students to the fact that they have increased their rate on that letter 40 or 60 words a minute, as the case might be. Assign another letter for the following week so the difficult parts can be practiced at home




### Wentworth, Self-taught, 100wpm
link

Wentworth reports on their own experience of learning Teeline without a teacher, passing a 100wpm certificate in 220 hours.

### Micromolar Method
link

Sevier compared the micromolar method to early introduction of new material, and found them equally effective, measured after 12 weeks of instruction. The micromolar approach only dictates at 100wpm, so you never get used to writing slower. It starts with very short dictations (10-15s) and, I assume, builds up. students were tested at lower speeds.

### Holding Your Pen

Some decades, teachers insist on exactly one hold and go to great extremes to enforce it. Then they over-correct and say to hold it any way you like. Try the most common holds, for long enough to see if they're better. Often they will feel uncomfortable and tiresome until your hand adapts. However, don't worry about it too much.

Leslie (Methods, p124) discusses the grips of some of his colleagues. Most, but not all, use variations of the tripod grip. Gaskell's Penman's hand-book, 1883 has images of contraptions to help train the hand. That's probably taking it too far.
