## Introduction

This was supposed to be a series of steps to learn shorthand based mostly on Leslie's Functional Method xxxx ref. Then I read more teacher handbooks, and a few studies comparing methods, and entirely rewrote it.

Every author is convinced that their method is best, but there  very little evidence behind many of them. Methods of Shorthand Instruction A research Analysis (Pullis, JM, 1973) was an eye-opener.

(References and links under...wait for it...References.)

The textbook and teaching method affects student success more than the system, as long as the system is not too extreme. Leslie's Functional Method for Gregg Anniversary (xxxref) had great success, even though it did not state the rules clearly, because it had so much well-written shorthand for each chapter, a key in the back, supplementary books, with tests for each chapter, instructions on how to teach new words, how much time to spend each day on each type of exercises, instructions for gradual increasing of difficulty, and ways to keep students interested, not because students did not write anything for the first half, even though delayed writing was the Big Thing it advertised. Gregg Publishing's large library, including magazines for teachers and stenographers, probably helped.



sss








Many of the studies saying one shorthand is faster are more influenced by the textbook than the shorthand.





Much of the advice is conflicting. Some of the advice is actually promises from the marketing department.

There is no doubt Leslie's Functional Method for teaching Gregg was more successful than the previous method, but that was probably due to the drastic increase in shorthand plates in each chapter and the enthusiasm of the teacher, not the extreme delay in picking up the pen lack of focus on rules and penmanship.





Most modern shorthand learners do not have the luxury of a teacher, or even a good self-instruction book (especially those of us who prefer older systems).

A good book will:
- introduce the material in an order that allows for natural language and interesting material as early as possible.
- have plenty of well-written shorthand to read and copy at all stages.
- say when to increase speed and when to move to the next type of practice.
- clearly state when enough rules have been taught that it is safe for you to write your own material.

This course will help you overcome those deficiencies in your book, and to do for yourself most of the things a good teacher would do. It gives more specific guidance to those who wish it; explains some of the reasoning behind the suggestions; reinforces common advice; and adds useful ideas not commonly found in other places.

Note that sometimes teachers disagree. Experiment and use what works for you.

Adjust this program as you see fit.

### Expectations

How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. Shorthand is a whole herd of elephants. Learning the theory is just one elephant, and generally takes a four-month course.

Most modern books for use in class spread the theory out fairly evenly over the semester, with enough practice in each chapter to fill the time. Thick self-instruction books don't sell, so those books have the theory but not much practice.

Even with the same book, some teachers speed through the theory. By mid-term their students can write anything slowly. Some spend more time each week building speed and work very slowly through the theory. Teenagers stuck in school will learn slower than young adults paying good money to learn an employable skill. Adults have other responsibilities and will learn slower.

Take full advantage of the exercises in each chapter. Build each one to your current best speed, or maybe a tiny bit more, then move on. When you finish the book you will have a firm grasp of the theory and write faster than longhand. If your book doesn't have enough material in each chapter to reinforce the theory, do your best. Either way, fully prepare dictations by writing them from text and checking carefully, until you can write new material accurately on your first attempt.

The Extras page has several examples of expectations. Many don't include students who dropped out, but could have succeeded if given more time. Some don't specify whether the speed is on new or practiced material. Many specify "terms" or "years" of the course, but not how many hours in that term. My high school's beginning shorthand class was 110 hours over 8 months. A business school might devote half or more of each day to the subject. Very few list length of test. Some are from marketing materials. (Teacher handbooks are a form of marketing.)

Your first goal is faster than longhand, not dictation. 




Books usually cover the theory in 3 months, to accommodate schools with l

ory, but takes a great deal of time and practice for brain and hand to build writing speed. A partial list of suggestions from teacher manuals and personal reports is xxx link



Many learners quit because they aren't progressing fast enough. Sometimes it's due to unrealistic expectations. Other times it's because they aren't making the best use of their time. (I wrote out the entire Forkner and Gregg DJS manuals, twice, slowly, but didn't build useful speed until I started dictation.)

Shorthand is like playing piano. I know the notes to play and when, and even what it should sound like, but can't read the notes fast enough to tell my fingers what to do. Even when I know what they should do, I can't make them do it.

Also like with piano, shorter and more-frequent works better than longer and less-frequent. Of course longer and frequent works even better. All the advice that music teachers give about how to practice can be applied to shorthand.

Reports on how long it takes to learn vary widely, even with the same system. 


Time to complete the theory and the early speed curve depends on how much practice you do in each chapter. Tests on "Unpracticed material" might be familiar words in new sentences, or entirely new words. Long dictations are harder than slow ones.

Note that, as with piano, learning the theory is the easy part. xxxx link has actual numbers from different books.

## Overview

How to go through the book the first time depends on how good the book is.

Some books have enough material in each chapter that you will learn it well before moving to the next. They have a mix of long and short material to help build endurance. If so, trust it. Follow the advice here for how to read, copy and take dictation.

Other books go through the rules quickly, with very little practice material in each chapter. In that case do the best you can with what you have.

Prepare all dictation by copying well-written shorthand or creating your own from text, until you truly master the theory (except for the occasional test).

After finishing the theory (but probably not mastering it), divide each hour of study into reviewing theory, reading your own writing, copying and/or dictation for half the hour, and penmanship practice.

* 15 minutes rereading the text and copying the examples (but not the exercises) Continue this until you have mastered the theory. This also warms up your hand. Continue this review until you reach 125wpm for five minute on unseen material

* 10 minutes reading your own writing. This is a skill you need to practice!

* 30 minutes copying and/or writing from dictation. Use a combination of [Pratt's Easy Intro to Dictation](https://www.reddit.com/r/shorthand/comments/1m1gsj5/comment/n3o4309/?context=3), Leslie's One Minute Speed Forcing Plan, and Swem's Systematic Speed Course for Advanced Writers.

  xxx add links.

* 5 minutes penmanship practice to end every writing session, no matter how short.

At first, copy all material several times before taking dictation. Gradually reduce that to only one or two copies, but no lower until you master the theory.

Once you have mastered the theory, and no longer need to write the shorthand before dictation, alternate between working on speed forcing and slower dictation you take only once and type the next day.

## Diary

Optional, but I find it useful to review the results of earlier experiments and to balance different types of exercises. This is for your own use. Be as specific or vague as you like.

You do not need to count or time all the readings or copies, but do enough that you get a feel for speed vs accuracy vs duration, and the effect of different exercises. The numbers will change rapidly at first, then settle down, then change again as you increase your target speeds.

Reading skill is as important as writing skill. Test it every few sessions.

## First Time Through The Book

Your goal at this stage is not to build speed, but to become familiar with the rules and the building blocks in a variety of settings, which is aided by a bit of speed. (Paraphrase of Leslie.)

Always end each session with five minutes of penmanship practice, described later.

If you have enough reading material, then delay memorizing the fine details of the rules. You will absorb them by reading word lists and sentences that show the rule in practice. Leslie goes so far as to say that if a student asks about details and reasons, they should be told to wait until the end of the course for an answer. (His students had the benefit of several pages of well-written shorthand for each chapter.)

Having said that, I find the words of the rules are useful when my hand hesitates and when discussing outlines online, but once I know what the letter group or word should look like (and similar words it should not look like) I just write it, without thinking about the rules. There is no time to think!

Many systems have more than one book. Some books agree on the theory. Some differ slightly. Some have better descriptions of the rules. Some have more practice material. Using two books at once can help, but it can also be confusing. Ask other writers of your system for advice.

If your book has enough material in each chapter, then follow that ratio of theory/practice and the gradual increase in length. If your book says to delay writing and/or dictation, or gives speed goals, use them. If your book does not mention penmanship practice or reading your old writing, it's probably in the Teacher's Manual. Use the advice here for that.

If your book says to just read *then keep reading*. Gregg Simplified, Functional Edition, takes this to the extreme. It has 54 lessons of theory (40 minutes in class and 40 at home for each lesson), with several paragraphs of shorthand in each chapter, and delays writing until lesson 21. Students already know hundreds of outlines by the time they pick up a pen.

If your book has enough material but you finished it without really learning the theory or building speed, reread the book and do each exercise. This will be more effective than working with material not graded to each chapter.

### How to Read Shorthand

Do not worry about deciphering difficult words at first. They will all be difficult! For now, seeing the building blocks in a variety of settings is more important than practice deciphering. Leslie recommends you keep one finger on the shorthand and the other on the key.

 When you can read 9/10 words reasonably well, try reading the entire sentence a second time before using the key. When you can read 19/20 words reasonably well, use the [Column Method](#column-method-to-read-difficult-words).

For each new word, or old word that you forgot:

* Spell it in shorthand and trace the outline, or watch your teacher write it on the board. Tracing it will help you make the shape accurately. Writing it yourself will not.
* Say the word.
* Repeat these steps if it felt too awkward, but don't worry too much. It will get easier.

This process will help lock in the shapes of each letter and combination, and the outline of the entire word. Doing this out loud involves multiple senses, which enhances learning. It also helps prevent skipping steps.

Do not do this for words you already know. When reading or writing longhand, you see or say `h`. You don't see or say `down, up, curve across, down` unless you are still learning your letters. Likewise, you don't write or say `T-H-E`, you just think `the`.

Reread each passage until you can read it without referring to the key. It is ok to memorize it. Point to each word as you say it so your focus doesn't drift.

As you gain experience, look for letters that often occur together, and think of them as a single letter. Eg TR and SH instead of T-R and S-H.

### Column Method to Read Difficult Words

The column method works well if you suspect a penmanship issue, or are not sure which of several sounds or abbreviations are intended. It also works for checking if a proposed abbreviation has other possible interpretations.

Make one column for each letter. The first row is the letter in shorthand. The following rows are your best guess at what each letter might be, roughly ordered by probability, written in plain text. Then work through all the combinations by brute force.

You will have to adapt it a bit if combinations of letters create word parts.

You may want to make a chart of letters by shape, including prefixes and suffixes, so you can look them up quickly.

xxx example image

### Two Bookmark Method

Optional.

One bookmark is for material you're actually studying; it moves slowly. The other is to preview the theory and maybe trace the example words; it moves quickly.

The goal of the first is to learn which details are important. Does a later chapter have a longer line? If so, the one in the first chapter shouldn't be full height. Does a later chapter give a squished circle a different meaning from the perfectly round one in chapter two? Reading just the theory and a few example words will do this.

You can use yet another bookmark to read ahead, reading all the examples carefully. It's a good way to fill time on the bus.

You will probably find the fast pass frustrating and overwhelming. That's normal, and nothing to worry about. You will master the theory when you study it properly. Do you remember trying to read books that were too difficult as a child? In addition, you will see things that are scary, like leaving out information. There will be lists of abbreviations to memorize. All systems have those, especially the faster ones. Switching systems will not help. I say this from personal experience.

Trust the system. There is enough information in each outline to keep it readable. The abbreviations make sense. (Some exception for unproven systems. Moat claimed that anyone who studied hard enough would have great success, but never found a volunteer to test it. It did not become popular.)

## After Finishing Theory

If you use shorter sessions, do one or two types of work each session, for the same ratios each hour. Always end with a bit of precision practice.

On days you cannot follow this program, or need a change, try other exercises. Clearly state your intention for each exercise. (Seeing what it feels like, and making productive use of a bus ride or long meeting are valid answers.)

## Reviewing The Theory

Review the theory and copy the material that demonstrates each rule. You will work through the book several times. Once you have mastered the theory, you can alternate the basic rule book with advanced theory. Use the review section if your book has one.

Swem recommends this practice until you reach 125wpm for 5 minutes on unseen material. You will work through the book several times.

## Reading Your Own Writing

Reading your own writing is a skill you need to practice!

Use material that has rested for a bit. This give you practice reading your own writing, and will catch bad habits early. Only read the attempts that you intended to be mostly legible, not the ones that forced speed. Practice a few words that need it. At first, focus on recent work (to catch bad habits quickly). Then gradually extend it to six months or more, so you practice reading old material. Note that your first writing will be so bad that, while it's good to read it to find problems to fix, you may not benefit from reading it later. Use your own judgement. (Keep a sample so in a year you can look back and see how far you've come.)

Read out loud and follow with your finger so you don't skip words. Typing it is even better.

Once you start Mailable Transcripts, some of your reading time will be on those, but continue to read your fast writing.

## How to Copy Shorthand

Copying well-written shorthand is the fastest way to learn how the building blocks go together. Copying can also help with building hand speed and endurance, but those will come later.

Warm up your hand, if you haven't already, by writing for five minutes. Use penmanship exercises from your system, or one similar, if you have them. [Pratt's One Line Method](https://www.reddit.com/r/shorthand/comments/1m1gsj5/i_thought_i_was_getting_the_hang_of_shorthand/) works well for warming up. Start slow -- and relaxed! -- and build speed as your hand warms up.

Read the entire shorthand passage in the same way before. Then copy four times using the Four Column Method (below) or [Pratt's One Line Method without dictation](https://www.reddit.com/r/shorthand/comments/1m1gsj5/i_thought_i_was_getting_the_hang_of_shorthand/). Read the entire sentence, then read a few words at a time and write them. Do not simply copy the shapes.

If you do not have a sample to copy, you will have to make your own. Be extra careful checking it.

Practice does not make Perfect, but it does make Permanent!

> Approximately a week of slow copying and slow dictation until the last initial diffuse movements have disappeared or are under control [before working on speed]. -- Leslie, Methods of Teaching Gregg Shorthand, page 363

There is a difference of opinion on how slowly to go at first. Earlier books insist on slow and accurate for a long time. Later books say go faster earlier. Write at a variety of speeds. Strangely enough, many shorthands are actually easier to write fast. The way you write will change when you speed up, and again as you get used to longer passages. Shapes will blur a bit. Your hand will change position. You'll even sit differently. Sometimes a position that's better in the long run takes some muscle building and stretching. 


Remember that if someone else can read it, it's legible, even if it isn't exactly the same shape as the book. Don't fight your hand for details that don't matter. (You may not know which details matter until reading all the theory.)

As you speed up, let the shapes form groups. Think `TR` instead of `T-R`.

### Four Column Method for Copying

This method combines reading well-written shorthand, writing, and reading your own writing into a single exercise. It works well at the copying stage, in the early stages of dictation when you should have well-written shorthand in front of you, when you cannot take dictation, and at all stages for penmanship practice. It also helps you build pen speed separate from brain speed.

It will not, however, help you build brain speed. I speak from experience. Only exercises that force you to think of outlines at speed will help brain speed.

Make four columns by dividing two pages into two columns each, so you can see all at the same time. Copy the passage from the book into the first column. Aim for a slightly uncomfortable speed, at which your notes are readable and follow the rules, but are not perfect. If you are creating your own material, write your first attempt in the first column and leave room for corrections.

The 1st column needs to be accurate, since it will be the model for the others. Accurate means legible and following the rules, not perfect penmanship. Go as slow as needed to reach this level, but no slower.

Check your work and make corrections. Choose a few outlines you struggled with and copy them a few times, then a few more including a few words on either side.

I sometimes do the first column of several passages, so I only have to carry my notebook to practice. This adds a delay between first writing and reading. It looks very different after the break. For now, though, go to the next step immediately.

Copy from the first column to the second, check your work, make corrections, and practice difficult sections. Then copy from the second column to the third, and the third to the forth. Check your work, make corrections, and practice difficult sections after each copy.

Speed up a bit for the 2nd column. Counter-intuitively, shorthand is easier to write neatly with a bit of speed. 

Speed up even more for the 3rd column. Go so fast that your writing is only 95% accurate. (If your goal for the exercise is penmanship, then go slower.)

The 4th and final column should be slow enough for 98% accuracy, but no slower. Your hand will remember this copy most. Too slow will teach slow writing. Too fast will teach inaccurate writing.

It will take a bit of practice to learn how fast to write each column. The speeds will increase over time. Some passages will be easier or harder than others. Find speeds that usually work and don't worry about it. By speed, I mean how hard to push yourself, but you can also do this exercise with dictation.

### Pratt's One Line Method for Copying

Easy intro to dictations. [Reddit, r/shorthand, June 10, 2025](https://www.reddit.com/r/shorthand/comments/1m1gsj5/i_thought_i_was_getting_the_hang_of_shorthand/)

This is similar, but uses one-line sentences or word groups (about 10 words), lines instead of columns, and more copies. See the Reddit post and [Pratt's site] for more details.

## Penmanship, Accuracy (Legibility) and Perfection

> In teaching shorthand we have given too little thought to the right posture and to the development of swift, effortless writing from the beginning. Many teachers place such emphasis on slow, careful writing that the habit of slow movement is fastened on the student. Afterwards, in the advanced work, the student finds it difficult, and sometimes impossible, to overcome the sluggish, painfully precise style thus acquired. He has no facility in "getting around corners,' as it were. Under pressure his notes go to pieces, just as the penmanship of the "copybook" penmanship student went to pieces when rapidity was required. -- Gregg, Making Shorthand Teaching Effective, 1921, page 17.



Mark the transcript (handwritten or typed), not the shorthand. Your shorthand should be legible to someone familiar with your style, and yourself in six months. Striving for perfect notes will slow you down. Besides, what is perfect?

(Small exception: UK journalists' shorthand was checked to ensure it could be used as evidence in a court of law years later. Maybe it's not an exception, since they check for long-term legibility, not perfection.)

Here is the same sentence by four different writers in a speed contest at 200wpm, probably Pitman. They're all readable. ("Let me begin, then, with the idea that all mankind are naturally lazy.") [Link to Reddit post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/shorthand/comments/1m46rqg/can_ai_translate_gregg_shorthand_written_about_40/)

Now for the other side:

orrectly written outlines very important. Faster writers make better outlines. I'm not sure if that's because those with incorrect oultines drop out, or faster writers are better students overall, work at accuracy.
12% of the outlines were incorrect, but that 12% contributed to 68% of the errors for non-deferred.
Deferred: Very slight increase in number of correct outlines read incorrectly, 0.42% -> 0.5%.
Incorrect outlines, ouch. same-day transcription, 19% of incorrect outlines incorrectly transcribed. Defer by a week and it goes up to 33%.

Note: Study doesn't clarify if correct means same style as book, or just correct theory.


xxx see extras for more from this study




Having said that, remember you will not know how much a shape can vary from the book until you finish the theory. Until then, aim for shapes that match the book in every detail, but don't obsess over it. After that, think about which parts of an outline are important, and which can safely degrade. Many of arbitrary-seeming rules result in outlines that are still legible even if degraded by speed.

You will have more time to write accurately at lower speeds as you increase your barely-readable speed, but practicing barely-readable outlines too often will train your hand to make those. Always make the best notes you can for the speed of the dictation.

Build a toolbox of penmanship exercises. Trace well-written shorthand. Write blindfolded. Copy single words, groups of words, entire lines, and entire passages. Use penmanship exercises from your system or a similar one. Invent more exercises and experiment!

Have an intention each time you choose an exercise. If it doesn't help the intention, choose another.

Sometimes work on problems you know you have. Other times work on other aspects. Often the real problem is something we think we already mastered.

Swem and Leslie both worked for JR Gregg. Leslie recommends against tracing outlines at any stage, but Swem suggests tracing shorthand in the textbook using a dry pen. This will force you to notice subtle details, but isn't always an option and may not give much variety. Some of that difference of opinion is due to different audiences. Leslie's students read entire paragraphs every day, and knew hundreds of outlines by site before picking up their pens. Swem's students have already completed the theory using an older book with fewer examples.

Different exercises work better at different stages. An exercise that stopped being useful last week might be useful again when you add more speed. Experiment!

(I'll save you one set of experiments: Practicing single letters rarely helps. The way you enter and exit the letter will affect how you write it. Write entire words and entire sentences. )

### A Note on Repetition

Teachers used to recommend slow careful copying of the exact shapes in the book -- lines and lines of a single letter or word, often before you know which details are actually important. This rarely does any good.

> Anything that is dull and uninteresting is of doubtful pedagogic value. Also, excessive repetition generally results in progressive deterioration of the outlines practiced.” -- Leslie, Gregg Shorthand Functional Method Teachers Handbook (1936)

As you repeat something, your writing will improve, then plateau, then degrade. Stop just before it begins to degrade. If you're happy with most of the repeats, you're done with the word. If not, then breathe, shake out your hand to reset, and continue. When it degrades again, that's as far as you should push that bit for now. Work on a different section or a different exercise and return to the first tomorrow. Our brains and bodies need sleep to consolidate new skills. (Some say a 10 minute break is enough. Experiment!)

Practice will not make Perfect, but it will make Permanent.

Always have an intention when you practice, and ask if the exercise is meeting that intention. Most of the time the goal will be swift, effortless, legible writing.

Always have an intent when you practice, and ask if the exercise is meeting that intent. The overall goal is swift, effortless, legible writing. Your goal for the exercise might be to master a shape or group of shapes, or to see how a shape degrades at speed, or any of a dozen other goals. Slow and careful copying rarely helps with any of those goals.

Vary the speed. Slow helps precision. Speed helps fluency and reduces hesitation. You need both. Try faster -- uncomfortably fast -- and see how the outline degrades, but only as an experiment. Try writing just one outline several times, then as part of a memorized group. What changed? What bit can you focus on that make the rest of the outline behave? Sometimes a word that works well at one speed will become a problem again when your overall speed increases. Repeat the procedure.

Try writing problem words as part of a group instead of an entire line of the same word.

Also try the opposite of any penmanship pointers. Gregg clearly states that circles between opposite curves go on the back of the first curve, but my hand relaxed more when I tried putting it inside the second.

Our brains and bodies remember the first and final repeats more than the middle ones. They should be as fast as possible while remaining legible.

Remember to relax!

### Find the Size Your Hand Prefers

Writing too small will slow your writing, since you need to be more precise. Too large will be awkward for your hand. Aim for a comfortable, flowing size. There are a few Gregg articles about size, with samples from expert writers. One fits 500 words per page, another fits only 100.

To Start: Draw straight lines on paper, a full inch [2.5cm] apart, and write a few sentences in cursive and/or print at whatever size your hand likes. Then measure the height of several letters. Typically lowercase letters are 2-3mm and uppercase letters are twice that. If your longhand is larger than average, then your shorthand will probably also be larger than average, and vice versa. Adjust a bit if needed to keep the lengths distinct.

Use that size when you start writing. The small letters should be as small as you can write comfortably, probably the size of lowercase longhand or smaller (since they're less complex). Large should be as large as you can write comfortable, at least 3-4 times the size of small. Medium should be between that, probably the size of your longhand capitals.

Once you know enough shorthand to write sensible sentences, try it again, then use the size your hand prefers. 
[Image of Gregg Letter Family](https://greggshorthand.github.io/anunit04.html) 

xxx todo make an image of the full set of shape families. Maybe Orthic this time, or Gregg vs Pitman

I only learned about this test a few years ago, and tried it after decades of writing Gregg. I discovered my hand was happier, accuracy better, and speed faster when my large letters were 8mm instead of 7.

Consistency is more important than exact lengths. All tall letters should be the same height. Using sizes your hand likes will make it easier to be consistent.

Repeat this test with shorthand every few sessions, at a different time in each session. Your hand will change when it's cold or tired, as it learns the shapes better, and as you build speed. Reduce the frequency of the test as your size becomes more consistent 

Experiment with skipping lines. Even if the size doesn’t change, it can give your hand a bit more freedom. Again, the results might change as your shorthand skill improves, possibly in an unexpected direction.

> The actual size of the characters may be varied according to circumstances, such as the goodness of the light and the writing materials. The minuteness of any kind of writing is limited by the size of the smallest characters. In Orthic the small size may be made as small as desired, and the small circle may be reduced to a dot, but it is best to make the small characters about one-twelfth of an inch long (2.1mm), and the large ones at least twice as big." — [Clarey Orthic Cursive Shorthand, Revised Extended and Improved, 1911, page 3.](https://orthic.shorthand.fun/)

Graph paper can help you practice consistent sizes, especially for horizontal lines, but it can backfire and make you try to be too perfect. Use it for precision drills when needed, but not as a regular practice. Use an online generator to make paper that fits your size, or something like "small letters are 3/4 of a cell."  

## Writing From Dictation

Finally!

Practice all material until you're confident you can write it well, gradually lowering the preparation to only one or two copies. Continue to make one or two copies before taking until your first writing of an exercise should be correct and readable, even if the penmanship isn't perfect.

without a sound file. Practice problem words a bit, repeat the line a few more times, make a sound file as she recommends or prepare material for computer dictation, for 20wp, which is painfully slow until you try taking dictation to it!

Your first few attempts will be terrible. Try it a few times, then practice words that need it and try again. When you stop improving, raise the speed to 30wpm and try again. See if you can reach 40wpm, but don't worry if you can't. Remember, your goal the correct shapes made legibly, not textbook-perfect penmanship.

Stay with slow, comfortable dictation while you get used to the process, practice the basic shapes, and get past what Leslie calls "initial diffuse movements." (These will happen even if your brain knows the shapes.)

Then use Leslie's One Minute Speed Forcing Plan 




Now try it at 30wpm, practice, retry, and see if you can get up to 40 or even 50, but don't worry if you can't. Stop trying when you don't seem to be getting any better.

Repeat with few more passages.






Some teachers speed up quickly, even if the students can't quite keep up, then slow down. Practicing at a higher speed than you can manage will help break patterns that are holding you back at lower speeds.




Then use the first part of Leslie's One Minute Speed Forcing Plan (see below) which balances work on accuracy, and speed. Add the remainder, which work on endurance, gradually as described later.









After mastering the theory, spend half the dictation time on speed building and half on what Leslie calls "mailable transcript" -- dictation slow enough for almost perfect notes (but no slower), one attempt only, and type it the next day (during typing class).

You might master the theory before building enough speed to start work on endurance. Use shorter pieces for the mailable transcript exercises and don't worry about it.

> There can be no question of the order in which to develop speed and accuracy. They must be developed concurrently but not simultaneously. It is an old error of the shorthand classroom to keep the learner trying to give the best combination of speed and accuracy on every writing. Each day the learner should *write most of the writings for speed only*, without regard to legibility. Each day the learner should write *some of the dictations for legibility only*, without regard for speed. The speed of those dictations should be moderate, so that the learner is free to devote all his attention to writing perfect shorthand notes. Thus it is important that the learner should seldom try to combine the two, yet should never go for a full class period without alternating the two.  -- Leslie, Methods of Teaching Shorthand, page 186 (Emphasis mine.)



### A Note on Making Your Own Material

Regardless of your book, only use material from it (or other books from the same system) until you finish the basic theory, to avoid conflicts with later rules. Do not add your own rules until you finish at least the intermediate theory, unless the book tells you otherwise. (Some books tell you to make your own abbreviations, but then continue to add official ones that conflict with the ones you made. This is annoying.)

Modern books usually have enough exercises that you do not have to make your own material until you know the basic theory well. Luxury!

Do not make your own material until you finish the core theory.

Forkner says to leave out vowels, so Can becomes CN, right? Several chapters later, they say that C means Can and CN means Cannot. All your old notes are wrong. For the next year, every time you try to write Can you will hesitate, and every time you read CN you will wonder if you wrote Cannot correctly or Can incorrectly.

Orthic and Teeline quickly teach an acceptable way to write all words -- just use the alphabet, letter-by-letter. Your hand then has to break that habit as you learn simple ways to drastically reduce writing.

If you aren’t sure where the core theory stops and optional theory begins, read more of the book, not to learn, but to see which sections are core theory, which are optional but useful, and which should wait. Some books separate those nicely. Some mix them together. Quickly reading the entire book will also give you advance warning of additional sizes, positions, and shapes that you might confuse with the earlier shapes if not aware.

**5 minutes practicing penmanship.**  

End each writing session, no matter how short, with accurate but not-slow writing. Music and driving teachers also recommend this. Your body remembers the final minutes of a lesson strongly.

Divide your penmanship time between tracing, penmanship exercises (usually repeating the same shape, or a family of similar shapes and outlines), and difficult areas of a recent exercise.

More tips on penmanship and repetition are in a later section.







## Personal Reference Binder

Optional, but I found it worthwhile.

Make a small binder of reference material, and add to it as you learn. Make sections for:

* Theory, sorted by lesson  
* Theory, sorted by alphabet (Include cross-reference entries between normal and shorthand spelling, so you can use it for reading or writing.)  
* Vocabulary (Only include abbreviations, words that demonstrate a new rule, and words you expect to struggle with.)

Only write as much of the rule as you need for quick reference. Include page reference. It will save time whenever you doubt your notes.

Update this book at the end of each homework session – after your hand is comfortable with the new shapes. Sort the contents of each page in any order that makes sense to you. The order does not have to be perfect.

When a page is filled, rewrite it spread over two or more pages, to make room for more.  This copying will help you remember the rules. You will need shorter explanations and fewer examples for familiar rules each time. I wouldn't omit rules, though, since a list can help with the column method for reading difficult words.

### A Note on Word Lists

No matter how much practice you get, and how many words reach the stages of familiar and mastered, there will still be many thousands of words that you have to build from scratch. Practice using the building blocks in a variety of words, instead of memorizing vocabulary or building a complete dictionary.

That is not to say word lists are never useful.

* A well-chosen list can be a review of the rules, or help you lock in a rule.  
* A list of abbreviations helps you remember to use them during dictation.  
* A list of names at the beginning of a meeting makes it easy to make temporary abbreviations.  
* A list of words that sound similar but have different meanings helps find ways to distinguish them.  
* A list in the back of your notebook can help you remember uncommon or difficult words, especially if you need them months later.

### Working With Word Lists — Spaced Repetition

As stated earlier, a list of all the words you encounter is a waste of time, but lists can be useful for other reasons.

The best way to learn lists is spaced repetition. Each time you successfully remember a word, promote it to a longer review frequency. If you struggle with a word you previously mastered, demote it. 

Some people use a deck of cards, one card per word, longhand on one side and shorthand on the other. Leitner Box is a famous system for managing repetition using cards. Apps such as Anki have virtual cards and keep track of which words should be repeated and how often. There might even be a shared deck for your system. I find the physical cards use too much paper and are hard to carry. It takes too long to scan and enter each word for a computer version, and your hand doesn't get practice with each repetition. (I used a program similar to Anki to study music vocabulary, which was text-only and easy to enter. I got 100% on that section of the exam.)

#### Accordion Fold Method for Word Lists

Write the longhand in one column and shorthand in the column beside it. Fold or cover the paper so you can only see the longhand. Write the shorthand in the next column, uncover the key, note the mistakes and practice as needed on another page. Adjust the paper so you can only see the shorthand column. Write the longhand in the next column and note the mistakes. (You can save time and paper by saying the longhand but not writing it. Say it out loud and point with your finger to avoid shortcuts.) Now repeat the process with only the words you didn’t get first try. Keep repeating, until you have gotten each word correct more often than you got it wrong, or you run out of time.

Copy all words with mistakes in the first column of a page with tomorrow’s date. You will work on them again then. Copy the words you always got correct to another page, marked with the date you want to review them.

Each time a word passes, double the time until the next review. If you get a word wrong, demote it all the way down to every day, and make it earn its way up again. Write the length of the streak beside the word.

## How to Take Dictation





Take dictation for which you have well-written shorthand as long as possible. You can often find well-written shorthand (or poorly-written and then critiqued) as Quote of the Day in shorthand groups. When you run out, use your own material. Write it, check it carefully, and rewrite neatly if necessary. Building speed on incorrect outlines wastes time.

Your first few hours of dictation should be gentle and comfortable. Use Pratt's One Line method, xxx link starting with very short exercises written multiple times, then dictated at 20wpm -- 

Do that, gently increasing speed, until you are comfortable with slow dictation and your hand is somewhat comfortable with the shapes. Then use the first steps of Leslie's One Minute Speed Forcing Plan xxx link to increase speed a bit. This plan writes one exercise multiple times, slowly, then faster, then so fast you can't possibly keep up, then slower to finish. It's a bit nerve-wracking at first. Continue to prepare the material before dictation.

At this stage, review and practice the theory by writing from text or very slow dictation. Practice pen speed from dictation of practiced material.

Continue to use just the first steps of Leslie's Plan, experimenting with increasing one type of difficulty at a time. (Starting speed, overshoot speed, final speed, and amount of preparation.) When you are at a reasonable speed, add remaining steps of Leslie's Plan to start increasing passage length. (There is no sense increasing length if it takes an entire minute to write 30 words.)

Be gentle with yourself. Pushing speed or reducing preparation too fast creates more problems than it solves.

When you have mastered the theory, reduce preparation even more (in steps), and add "mailable transcript" to your dictation practice. Mailable transcript material is dictated only once, slow enough to be read easily (but no slower), then typed the next day for mailing. (Typing it the next day is a surprisingly useful step, more useful than just reading it out loud.)




When you reach 80wpm for 5 minutes on unseen material, readable but only barely, alternate passages  between Leslie's One Minute Speed Forcing Plan and Swem's Systematic Speed Course. xxx link (Swem suggests these numbers. Start sooner if you want the variety.) Leslie's Plan starts slow and builds, then drops, and combines several short sections into one longer one. On most days, Swem's starts with a single long passage at just above readable speed, drops to "practically perfect," and builds back up to the first speed. On some days it uses other methods. Swem's course also has advice for breaking through plateaus.

If, after you get familiar with Swem's system, you prefer one method over the other, then use the one you prefer most of the time and the other when you hit a plateau.

When you reach 125wpm for 5 minutes on unseen material, readable but only barely, stop reviewing the basic theory. (Numbers from Swem.) Continue to review advanced theory until you have mastered the parts that make sense for your application.




> The goal toward which you are striving is to reach the point where you can take new matter at your top speed and write it as well as you would after taking it two or three times. Of course, no matter how much skill you may eventually acquire you will occasionally "flunk" an outline or a phrase. In reading it back you will correct it, but the fact that you wrote it incorrectly the first time should be no cause for worry. It is done by everybody. Your aim should be simply to bring these errors down to a minimum. — Swem

That's a far distant goal. Start where you are -- with shaky knowledge of the theory, and hand and brain that struggle to make the basic shapes.

There are three main stages to learning, and several methods. Different methods work better at different stages.

xxx add links to this  mini toc ??

Stages
  * Learning Theory. Prepare all passages thoroughly before dictation.
  * Reduce Preparation. Gradually reduce preparation. Your first dictation of each passage will be slower to compensate.
  * Building Skills. Continue to review theory while building speed and endurance.

### Text Reader (aka Dictation) Programs

I prefer to use a text reader instead of making my own sound files. Just paste the text, set the speed, and click Start. Yes, it sounds unnatural, especially at slow speeds, but that's a small price to pay for the ease of use.

Most text reader programs (aka test to speech) are too fast for early dictation, or are not properly calibrated. These are pretty good:

* [http://qwertysteno.com/Dictation/](http://qwertysteno.com/Dictation/)  
It doesn’t sound as nice as a human dictator, but it’s a lot more patient. This site lets you save text files (nice if you prepare on the computer then take your phone to the kitchen table for dictation). It will dictate at random a list of words you enter.

* [https://www.naturalreaders.com/online/](https://www.naturalreaders.com/online/)  
This one is reported to sound better, and may do other languages. Its slowest is 50wpm, which is a bit fast for new writers.


### Stage 1: Learning Theory

Only write material from the textbook until you finish the theory, unless the book says otherwise, for reasons given earlier.

***Delay writing*** as long as you can. Your pen will still be wobbly the first few times you write, but your brain will know the building blocks and how they fit together, and you will avoid most mistakes made by new writers. If the book is short, read all of it before writing. Then read it again, this time writing all the examples and exercises. Then go through it a third time, this time taking dictation.

### First Few Dictations.

***Delay dictation*** until your hand is comfortable with your system's shapes and you can copy with 95% accuracy. Then be cautious about adding speed until you can write legibly from dictation at lower speeds.

> Approximately a week of slow copying and slow dictation until the last initial diffuse movements have disappeared or are under control [before working on speed]. -- Leslie, Methods of Teaching Gregg Shorthand, page 363

  That assumes 40 minutes/day in class (some spent on overhead, theory, and listening to classmates read their writing out loud) and equal time at home.

Read Leslie's advice for the first few weeks of dictation. xxx link Graded means leveled, associated with a chapter in the textbook.

He does not recommend speeds, but I suggest starting with 10 words at 20wpm. Use [Pratt's One Line Method -- Easy Intro to Dictations](https://www.reddit.com/r/shorthand/comments/1m1gsj5/i_thought_i_was_getting_the_hang_of_shorthand/), without a sound file, until your hand is comfortable with the passage, then with sound. Start with 20wpm, then increase by 10wpm several times. Keep increasing until you're uncomfortable but still successful, then do a final attempt between starting and top speed.

For your next passage, increase the starting speed by 10wpm. 













The goal for your **first passage** is to become comfortable with the process.

Remember that this is an experiment, not a test.

Choose a passage of approximately 10 words, and break it into one-line (approx 10 word) sections. 

Dictation should be introduced
by the use of practiced matter, without pressure for speed, accuracy,
or legibility. From the beginning all dictation should be repetitive,
but at first it is well to avoid the extreme pressure later associated
with the 1-minute, repetitive dictation plan described in this chapter.
Let the learner take his time. Do not watch his writing. Do not
check his notes. Do not require him to read back. Give the learner
time to get out of the stage of initial diffuse movements before
applying pressure; the final results will be better.
3. How long a dictation? For the first few days the dictation
may profitably be limited to 30-second readings. After a few days
two 30-second readings may be combined into a 60-second reading.
From that time on, in general, 60-second readings seem the optimum length, with an occasional 30-second reading to enable the
learner to write at a higher rate than he can get on the 60-second
readings and with an occasional reading of 2, 3, 4, or 5 minutes.












Now use Pratt's One Line Method to take dictation for several reps at 20, 30, 40, and 50wpm.

The first few reps of your first ever dictation will be horrible. Keep going. If you notice a problem area after the 3rd, stop and work on it. Repeat until it's legible and somewhat comfortable, but not perfect. Don't waste time on unnecessary repeats. The speeds follow the pattern in steps 1-8 of Leslie's One Minute Speed Forcing Plan -- Leslie, Methods of Teaching Gregg Shorthand, page 174.

40wpm will be pretty bad and 50 impossible. Follow the advice Leslie gives in step 7: "Not all the learners may get this fourth dictation, but urge them to keep on and write as much of it as they can get consecutively. They are not to drop a few words and then resume writing." -- Leslie, Methods of Teaching Gregg Shorthand, page 174.

When you drop down to 30 it will feel very slow.

This finishes your first passage. Congratulations!

That's the first 8 steps of Leslie's plan, with a bit of extra repetition as you got used to taking dictation and to compensate for the extremely short sentence.

All these attempts are experiments, not tests that you pass or fail! Ask yourself what changes when you increase speed, or on the third repetition? Think widely. Posture? Pen grip? Nerves? Details of some outlines? Something else? Or ask if you can write legibly at that speed, or if you can at least get something down for each word. Some questions will be more useful than others for different attempts. Experiment!

(Leslie is very much against tests. Tests do not teach. They challenge too many skills at the same time, and can make students worry -- which interferes with their performance. Use other methods to decide what to work on next. Do as few tests as possible to satisfy the school board. Do just enough test-like practice that the students are well-prepared for the test. Build their confidence by starting with easy material and do not set them up for failure. Then spend most of the time actually building shorthand skill.)

2nd passage: Repeat the previous process, but skip the 20wpm attempt. The other speeds remain the same. You will probably find the first attempt difficult but doable, but might need an extra rep.

3rd: Use 30, 40, 50, 60, 30wpm -- increasing the top speed only. If you felt this speed useful (but not necessarily legible) continue to use it. If not, continue to use the old value.

4th: Increase the final speed to 40wpm. Again, if it was reasonably successful, continue to use it, otherwise use the old value it for the next passage.

Continue to rotate through these experiments one at a time: starting speed, top speed, final speed. Repeat one if you feel you are close to a permanent improvement. Try to keep the pattern of starting, +10, +20, +30, (+10 or +20). If one speed improves too fast, try a bit harder to increase the others to stay close to the pattern.

Once you reach 40wpm for the final attempt, and it's legible, combine two passages into a single 20 word passage and write it at 30wpm just once, or maybe twice since this is your first attempt at a 20 word passage. Double the length, lower the speed by 10wpm. If this was reasonably successful, start to use 20 word passages without dividing them. Only repeat it enough to fill a minute at the slowest speed. Otherwise continue to combine every 2 passages into a longer one, and add 20 words 







When you reach 50wpm for the final attempt, increase dictation length to 40 words. Build each half as before, then combine and lower the speed by 10wpm. Alternatively, trust your textbook for lengths. If it's too long, divide it in half, build each half as usual, then combine them. Remember that doubling the length lowers the speed by 10wpm.

When you reach an entire minute for your first attempt, switch to Leslie's One Minute Speed Forcing Plan. xxx link to my typing -- Leslie, Methods of Teaching Gregg Shorthand, page 174








Now drop 30wpm again for 2 reps. It will feel much easier.



The goal for your **second passage** to get experiment with increasing your starting speed. Actual speedbuilding is still a few passages away.

Choose a 10 word text and prepare it as before, but this time do dictation at 30, 40, 50, and 30 spm. Note the top speed is still 50.

The goal for your **third passage** is to experiment with increasing the duration. Choose a 20 word passage, prepare it as before, start at a comfortable speed, build to 





. Copy it a few times. Use Pratt's method if you think it will help. Then take dictation at 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60wpm, working on problem areas between each attempt, and repeating only if you think a repetition will help. Follow the same advice as before when you fall behind. Do a final take at 40wpm.

The goals and procedure for your **third passage** are to continue to reduce preparation and to increase duration.

Now combine the two passages into 60 words and take it at 30wpm. As length goes up, speed goes down.

Repeat this with two more 30-minute passages, combine




If you were comfortable after only a few attempts at 20wpm, start your next passage at 30. Increase by 10wpm, for a total of 5 speeds, then drop to the second speed for the final take.

Continue this way, gently pushing the speed of the first dictation, until your first attempt is at xxx and reasonably legible. Your fourth attempt will be at 




Repeat 

Try increasing the starting speed by 10wpm each new section, until you find a starting speed you are comfortable with. It should be 95-98% accurate. Keep the top speed at 50wpm. 

Combine the two quarters into a half, lower the speed to 30wpm, and take dictation.

Repeat for the next two quarters. Combine into a half as before.

Finally, combine it into a whole. Normally you would drop another 10wpm for this attempt, but that brings it down to 20wpm, which by now will feel glacially slow. What a difference from the start of the session!







The total length should be one minute at your starting speed. Write the entire passage once from the text, correct it, then write it neatly, practice problem areas, and maybe write it a third time. Instead of breaking the entire passage into 10-word sections using Pratt's method, just write problem words with a few words on either side -- unless you think Pratt's method would help. This stage is a balance between enough preparation for a successful first dictation, and wasting time on unnecessary preparation.

Divide it into quarters (15 seconds each). Prepare sound or text tiles of each, repeating each one a few times, but you .

Use Leslie's method as before. The starting and top speeds should be a bit faster than comfortable, but not stressful. (Pushing for speed too early does more harm than good.)

The goals for your **third passage** are to reduce the total number of copies to get the same results and increase length to 2 minutes at the starting speed.

Some books have less practice for each chapter, so you finish the book faster, but at a lower speed. Others have more practice, so by the time you finish the book you also have higher speed. Work with the book you have, then alternate comfortable starting speed with slightly challenging, and occasionally throw in extremely challenging.

If your book increases length (either gradually or in the last few chapters), trust it. If you don't have that guidance, then alternate a comfortable length with a challenging length. Each one practices different skills.

Is length by starting or final speed? At first, use the starting speed to avoid excessively long sessions. As your speed increases, the difference will shrink so the question is less important.

What is your actual speed? For job interviews and contests, use your legible (barely, but still legible) speed for unpracticed material, which is currently zero. Don't worry. You will get there!

That's a lot of alternating!

There are four things to challenge -- one at a time: Length, starting speed, top speed, and final speed. Rotate through them, so one is challenging and the rest are comfortable. Each challenge speed is 10wpm faster than the comfortable speed. Challenge length is 30s longer than comfortable.

Now add one more thing: Sometimes double the challenge -- increase the speed by 20 or even 30wpm, or the duration by a full minute, and see what happens. You might surprise yourself! Even if you realize it's not doable, continue the dictation, getting down at least something for each word. if you fall too far behind, finish your current sentence, skip a few sentences, and pick it up again.

Another exercise is to try an extremely fast dictation, and see how much you can write before losing the thread entirely.





Now it's time for the first part of [Leslie's One Minute Speed Forcing Plan](cr-shorthand-course-extras.md#leslies-one-minute-speed-forcing-plan), slightly modified for lower speeds.

I don't understand exactly how his math works. Does step 8 start at word 101, or where the previous 75wpm take take ended? I say keep it simple: Divide the passage into quarters. Adjust a bit to avoid splitting sentences. Build the first quarter up to speed. Ignore the bit about "words previously dictated plus a few more." Adding words to fill the minute works, and is a good variation, but makes the math more complex, especially at lower speeds.

Adding more words into the minute is a useful exercise, but complicates the math. More math -> more ways to procrastinate.








The goal for the **fourth passages** is to increase length to 4 minutes at starting speed.

The goals for your **fifth and subsequent passages** are to finish the theory and build speed to 60wpm for 1 minute. This usually takes about 100 hours. At this speed the cost of an extra few strokes is much less than the cost of hesitation over a rule or slowing down because your hand doesn't know the shape. That changes somewhere above 100wpm.

Rotate through the following experiments, one per passage.

* Increase starting speed by 10 wpm.
* Increase top speed by 10 wpm.
* Increase final speed by 10 wpm.
* Only one attempt, slow enough that you can write legibly, then type it neatly the next day. Leslie calls this a mailable transcript. It will be slower than your normal starting speed. Increase this speed when your normal starting speed increases.


xxx what duration for mailable? Rotate, I guess, or slowest?

Each experiment works on a different skill. The cycle prevents stagnation.

When you are almost comfortable with a new speed, continue that experiment for a few passages until it sticks, without changing the other numbers.

In addition to Leslie's method, begin each session by re-reading the final attempt at each passage in your last session. You will see new problems.
























I recommend:

* Use only the first bit (build speed on 1-minute passage, overshoot, then drop) for most dictations until you master the theory.

* Use the full plan until you can write 80wpm for 1 minute on your first attempt on new material. That would be 70wpm for the halves and 60wpm for the whole. That's 80x4 = 320 words, just over 5 minutes.

* Alternate Leslie's Speed Forcing and Swem's Systematic Speed Course (modified) (below) until you reach 80wpm on new material for 5 minutes. Leslie's begins with a comfortable speed, builds up, overshoots, then does a final slow take. Swem's starts with a very fast take, slows to a comfortable speed, then builds back to the initial speed.

* Continue with Swem's Systematic Speed Course (unmodified) until you reach your goal.




I recommend speeds that allow 95% accuracy, maybe 90% for the highest, and 98% for the final mid-speed take. Leslie thinks it should be higher.

If your first attempt is <95% accurate, work on the problem areas and try again. There is no benefit to increasing speed of incorrect outlines.

Leslie builds speed by squeezing more words into one minute. That has the benefit of not anticipating the last word. Using the same number of words and letting the dictation take more or less time has the benefit of less math. Experiment.



Immediately after reducing preparation your starting speed will drop, but your top speed will not. Four writings might not be enough to reach top speed. If this happens, alternate preparation methods. On some passages work on dictation with less preparation. On other passages work on higher speed. Do not work on both at the same time if it reduces the variety of material in a week.















alternate with mailable transcript















Some books have typed passages only using known words, and typed passages with new words using known rules, in each chapter. Sometimes this is keys in the back or in a separate book. If so, you can start writing from this typed material and/or use it for dictation before finishing the theory.

For your first few dictations, practice each short section using Pratt's Easy Intro to Dictation. Write the same line multiple times. Full details below. Reduce this stage over your first few passages.

Use Leslie's One Minute Speed Forcing Plan for dictation. Divide into four sections. Start slow. Build to very fast, then slower and accurate. Combine into halves. Combine into whole. See Practice Methods for complete description and how to adjust for your first few passages. Full details below.

Have the shorthand sample in front of you while taking dictation. This will help reduce hesitation. You will automatically stop looking at it as you get faster.

Both authors agree that repetition is very useful at this stage. It reinforces theory, gets your hand used to the shapes and moving at speed, and your brain used to keeping up. Learning to write new shapes on the fly is a separate skill, learned later.

This stage ends when you can write 95% of new material without hesitation.

### Stage 2: Dictation with no Preview

Practice only words that worry you, then drop the preview altogether.

Your starting speed will drop when you reduce preparation. It will take more repetitions to reach final speed. Alternate methods for a few dictations. 

### Stage 3: Building Speed and Endurance

By now theory should not hold you back. Reread the book and copy the example words or sentences for 15 minutes of each hour of study to reinforce the rules. Most 2nd year books review basic theory. If yours does not, then alternate books. If you do not have a 2nd year book, do your best with what you have.

Leslie doesn't say how long to continue to use his plan. I suggest you continue using it in rotation until you feel it no longer useful.

Swem's Systematic Speed Course for Advanced Writers says to start when you can write legibly at 80wpm for 5 minutes. The first dictation is so fast you can barely keep up, followed by practically perfect, then increasing to the original speed or maybe faster, but "much better than your first attempt." Full details are below.

Dictation of new material slow enough to write neatly is as important as dictation of new material fast enough that you sometimes miss words, so use both!

Once you start reach 80wpm for 1 minute, I suggest 4-minute passages (time at final speed for long dictation) and rotate through:

* Divided into quarters, using Leslie's One Minute Speed Forcing.

* Not divided. Use the same speed building sequence as for shorter passages. Your starting speed will be lower than for short passages. As an intermediate step, divide a long passage into halves instead of quarters.

* Divided into quarters. Use Swem's Systematic Speed Course, then combining as for Leslie's method.

* Not divided. Use Swem's Systematic Speed Course. Again, divide into halves as an intermediate step. (Consider delaying this experiment until you reach the recommended level for Swem's course.)

* Other exercises from Swem's Course, but only after you reach the recommended skill.

* Long passage slow enough to be legible, but only taken once. Read it out loud tomorrow, or, better, type it. Leslie calls this "mailable copy."

Reduce repetitions of some exercises if you feel you have mastered the skill they teach, but don't drop them entirely until you reach 100wpm for 5 minutes. Often a skill you think you have mastered is actually the one holding you back.

Reading well-written shorthand is the best way learn how the rules work together, but only works if you have reading material.

Taking dictation involves several skills: Remembering familiar words, using the rules to build new words, making your pen write it accurately and quickly, and endurance. Sometimes work on each skill separately. Sometimes put a few of them together. Learning the rules so you can reduce preparation level is more important than speed. Dictation fast enough to make you focus and keep your pen moving smoothly forces your brain and hand to work without hesitation and highlights problem areas.

If you have the luxury of written shorthand keyed to the text, use that for dictation. It is much easier to write correctly if you know what it is supposed to look like. Only move to new material when you have mastered the theory.

Leslie recommends that students take dictation with the shorthand image in front of them, especially when they are new to dictation and trying to apply several new skills at the same time. All students – fast, slow or lazy – will reduce their reliance on the text as their confidence and speed increase.

If you do not have written shorthand to copy, you will need to make two copies before starting. Write it once, make corrections and look up the rules, then write it neatly and correctly.

If you can increase the starting speed without sacrificing accuracy, do so. If you can push a passage faster, do so, but do not get stuck trying to improve it. Some passages are difficult just because the outlines are new, and are easy to speed up; others are difficult because the outlines are awkward. Some days are better than others. Try to minimize the times you go too fast, but don't be afraid of pushing, as long as your last attempt is at a fast but accurate speed.

### First Few Dictations

> For an easy intro to dictations, you can use just one easy sentence but repeated say five times in a single sound file, to make a longer "passage", in order to remove outline recall obstacles and just get used to the dictation scenario of having to write without hesitation...You can do the same without a sound file, just write the same sentence down the page, and by the time you get to line 20, you feel you've gone from snail to racehorse, gets the juices going and the cobwebs gone. (Beryl Pratt, [Reddit, July 17, 2025](https://www.reddit.com/r/shorthand/comments/1m1gsj5/comment/n3o4309/?context=3))

Copy a 10-word passage a few times, until your pen is happy with it or you fill the page, whichever comes first

 Take dictation at 20wpm a few times, increase to 30wpm, repeat that speed a few times, then go to 40wpm or even higher if you find it too easy. Your goal at this stage is to get used to taking dictation and find a comfortable speed, not to build speed. 

Read your work carefully, especially the preparation and first dictation of a passage. Make corrections, and practice difficult areas as needed after each dictation.

It is ok to lag behind by a few words. This is called carrying, and is a useful skill. It lets you get a better sense of the words before writing, and helps you stay on track when the speaker speeds up for a short time. Advice varies between 5 words and half a sentence. Some teachers do not let students start writing until a few words in, to train carrying ability. Experiment, but remember that is a separate skill.

When a word slows you down, practice it a few times, then practice it with the words around it. Often the word we think is the problem is only the messenger. The real problem is a few words earlier. Even if you accurately identify the problem, it helps to have be confident in the run-up to it, to avoid tension. Adding a few after reduces the pause to celebrate success.

Repeat with another 10 words, then put them together for a 20-word dictation. Expect to slow down by 10wpm when you increase the length. Your goal at this speed is to get used to slightly longer dictations, not to build speed.

Repeat the process twice more so you have two 20-word passages at speed. Combine them into a 40-word passage and take that a few times. Remember that longer passages are harder, so you will need to slow down.

Now repeat the process but starting with two 20-word passages.

Finally, try a 40-word passage. Your first attempt will need to be very slow!

### Dictation Before Finishing Theory

Now you have confidence you can write for a minute at 40wpm or even faster on practiced material. You know the difference between a word you don't know and a word that's hard to write, how it feels to write smoothly at speed, and what it's like to work on a problem area.

At this stage, there is no benefit to fast dictation without preparation. This stage ends when you can prepare entire passages at 95% accuracy on the first writing.

I used to have a clear progression, of what to increase or decrease when (preparation, starting speed, final speed, duration), but then I read yet another teacher manual from a respected author. There is little consistency.

We'll start with what most modern teachers agree on:

* A short session each day is better than a single long session each week. (Of course a long session each day is even better.)

* As you increase the challenge in one skill (penmanship, preparation, speed of writing, length of passage), the others will suffer. Lower your expectations for a few passages, then bring them up again.

* You need a variety of types of practice: Penmanship. Reading. Writing practiced material. Reading your own writing. Dictation slow enough you can write neatly. Dictation fast enough you struggle to get something for every word. Dictation at intermediate speeds. Simple and complex material. Short and long.

* Also important, but should be left for a bit later:

  * Reducing preparation. Continue to write each exercise until your pen is happy with it, until you know 95% of the words in most exercises. Then read the text and practice new words until you can do that without hesitation. Then dictation with no preview on with words you know, and, finally, dictation with words you don't know.

    Do not worry about practice writing new words. Even when you prepare material, you will forget some of the words. Write a few letters and get the rest of the sentence. Then look it up and practice it.

    If you have the luxury of exercises keyed to the text, follow their instructions. They will have new words using theory you already know.

* Reading and copying shorthand teaches you the correct shapes faster than writing words from scratch. The Functional Method of teaching Gregg Shorthand goes even farther: Students wait several weeks before picking up a pen, by which time they know what hundreds of words should look like. All dictation is from practiced material, except for tests required by the school board and a bit of practice for them, for several more weeks.

* Reading your own writing, both immediately after writing and after you forget the content, is important for many reasons.

* End each session with penmanship practice. Experiment with different speeds. Write fast enough to be fluid.

* Practice problem words at a variety of speeds. See how they change as you speed up. Think about different parts of the word. Sometimes thinking "up" at the right time can make the word come together. Learn how the shapes degrade at speed, and how to keep them legible. Only let them degrade as necessary to keep up.

* If a rule causes repeated problems, practice a list of words that use that and related rules.

* Mark the transcript, not the shorthand. The shorthand has to be readable, but not perfect.
 
* Stick to words that are in the book until you finish the theory, or until the book tells you that you can go off-book.

* It is impossible for you to practice all words you might encounter. When you finish the theory, work on using the building blocks in a variety of words, not on building vocabulary. There is a subtle but important difference.

* Building blocks are more important than rules. You know what TR looks like, and don't need to say "R is counter-clockwise after T." Leslie says if a student asks for clarification, the teacher should tell them to write the word as shown, and wait until the end of the book for the answer. Having said that, when preparing passage I find it easier to recite a rule than to look up similar words.

* Build each passage to top speed. Authors disagree on the definition of top speed. Some teachers push to 40 or 60wpm quickly, finishing the theory without too much more speed building, then work on speed. Leslie recommends the opposite. See A Note on Speed, below.

> It is true, however, that if a learner is permitted to stay at 60 words a minute until he can pass tests with 1-5 errors consistently, his progress is being harmed. He becomes so accustomed to writing at that speed that he finds difficulty in going up to 80 words a minute. If he is started up toward 80 as soon as he can write 60 within 10—20 errors, it is much easier to make the transition to the higher speed. This is true at each speed-step on the ladder. -- Leslie, Methods of Teaching Shorthand, page 187.

10-20 errors in 60 words is only 67-84% accuracy. I worry about penmanship and bad habits at that speed.

* Separate speed and accuracy practice.

> There can be no question of the order in which to develop speed and accuracy. They must be developed concurrently but not simultaneously. It is an old error of the shorthand classroom to keep the learner trying to give the best combination of speed and accuracy on every writing. Each day the learner should *write most of the writings for speed only*, without regard to legibility. Each day the learner should write *some of the dictations for legibility only*, without regard for speed. The speed of those dictations should be moderate, so that the learner is free to devote all his attention to writing perfect shorthand notes. Thus it is important that the learner should seldom try to combine the two, yet should never go for a full class period without alternating the two.  -- Leslie, Methods of Teaching Shorthand, page 186 (Emphasis mine.)

> [Students should have the] opportunity to write about 20 per cent of the dictation under ideal conditions for perfect formation of the outlines. -- Leslie, Methods of Teaching Shorthand, page 363

  If your legible speed for the first dictation is within 40wpm of your top speed, then it's easy. Start Leslie's One Minute Speed Forcing Plan at your legible speed, write it 3 more times working on speed speed, then once more at the final speed (which should also be legible). That's five total dictations, with one legible on the first try and one legible after practice. Eg 60, 75, 90, 100, 75.

  If the gap is much bigger, then either add another step or begin one half to one fifth of the exercises at the slower speed.


* Hesitation loses more speed than a few more strokes. (See section on Klein's Motion Picture Study.)

* Only use the brief forms and phrases in the book. Too many create hesitation. (Slight exception for words you use often, such as your name.)

* Use a pyramid plan to build endurance. See Leslie's One Minute Speed Forcing Plan, below.

* If you have problems at slow speeds, it's because either you don't know the theory well enough, or you are letting a few difficult words throw you. In the first case, do more preparation. There is no benefit to unprepared dictation before you know the theory to support it. In the second, increase your speed even more. Force your pen to keep up with the easy bits, and identify which bits need more work.

What they disagree on:

* Some say to write at a consistent speed. Others say go slower for some words or phrases, faster for others. Try both. There are benefits to both types of practice.

* Some insist on perfect penmanship before each speed increase. Others say that increasing top speed (reducing hesitation) will automatically improve penmanship at lower speeds. I found the latter, plus writing problem words several times, worked best. (See A Note on Repetition.)

* Some say to continue to prepare each passage thoroughly before taking dictation until you finish the theory. Others say to reduce preparation quickly. I say reduce preparation when your first attempt at writing (copying shorthand, writing from typing, or writing from dictation) is 95% accurate -- when you need to think about only 1 word in 20.

 * The stages are: 
    * Copying several times.
    * Copying only once.
    * Looking for new words and writing them a few times.
    * No preparation.

    Correct mistakes and practising problem areas after every copy and dictation attempt.

* Some say stay with 1-minute dictations until students reach 60 or even 80wpm and know all the theory well. Others say to increase the duration earlier.

* Some say increasing speed on short dictations will automatically increase speed for long dictations, without any extra types of exercises. (Leslie) xxx get ref

  Others say duration requires practice in remaining focused, and you can do that by making a recording of the same sentence multiple times at your target speed. (Pratt)

  I say they're both right. Try both methods. The one that works best will depend on your current problem.

* Some say to write each new word a dozen times. Others say write sentences with the new words a dozen times. Others say write each word only a few times. (See A Note on Repetition.)

* Some say to find a dozen example words for each new rule. Some use only a few. I find more is better, within reason.

* Some say you should rarely write so fast it's illegible. Others say that should be most of your dictation. They do, however, agree that you need to practice a range of speeds. Even Leslie, who says 1-minute dictations, higher speed, is the answer to most problems, recommends a mix of practice. See A Note On Speed, below.

* Some say the first dictation of a passage should be slow enough to be accurate. Others say the opposite.

> Never mind your notes (just so they are kept within reasonable bounds) and do not bother about phrasing or anything else. Just get it down some way or another. (Swem's Systematic Speed Course)

  I found the former (slower) works better when I start learning a new system and the latter (faster) works better for systems I already know, unless I'm rusty.

* Some say to write fewer passages per day with more repetitions. I find writing about 5 times works best. (See Leslie's One Minute Speed Forcing Plan, below.)

* Some say writing shorthand from typed material is useful practice. Leslie says it's waste of time. Leslie's students had the luxury of  an entire book of shorthand that adds theory a bit at a time, and a teacher to check their work. If you also have this luxury, copy from the shorthand most of the time, then, when you have learned enough theory to use new material, write from the typed key and check it against the shorthand.

  Some students reformat the passage into a narrow column, print it, and write the shorthand in the other column. Others print it with space between the typing to write the shorthand. Others just keep one finger or a ruler on the typing.

* Some say you should use a variety of material from the start. Leslie says to build speed with easy material, usually business letters, until 100wpm. -- Leslie, Methods of Teaching Gregg Shorthand, page 187

* Some say to dictate evenly, others say vary the speed as in actual dictation. Leslie says stay with even dictation until later. 

> Uneven dictation is more difficult to write than even dictation. Therefore when the learner is still in the practice stage, he should be given even dictation. Just before he is ready to go into the business office he should be given the office-style dictation already described in this chapter. -- Leslie, Methods of Teaching Gregg Shorthand, page 188.

### Experiments

Every 5th passage, experiment with less preparation, a faster starting speed, a faster top speed, or a longer passage. (Your diary will help you remember which you did last.)

Then take a 10-word sentence from the next passage, practice it a few times, and see how many times you can write it in 1 minute. As your hand learns the shapes, basic building blocks, and chains of blocks, it will get faster.






### Other Notes

Move to [modified Swem's](#starting-swems-systematic-speed-course) when your first dictation of new material is 60-80wpm with 95% accuracy, and all the mistakes are due to lack of pen speed, not lack of knowledge.

> At first the subject of shorthand is so interesting and the reading approach is so easy that the learners are delighted with the reading. After the first few weeks of the study of shorthand by any method, the learner’s enthusiasm runs low. When the reading approach has been used, the enthusiasm is revived by the introduction of writing [material prepared at home]. When the enthusiasm begins to run low again, the enthusiasm is revived when the new-matter dictation is introduced with the preview [of new words, about 10% of the dictation]. When the stimulating effect of that novelty begins to wear off, new-matter dictation without a preview is introduced, causing a new revival of interest. -- Leslie, Methods of Teaching Gregg Shorthand, p 86.

### Experiments and Challenges.

Try an experiment every 5th passage, from this list or anything else that strikes your fancy. These are experiments and maybe practice, not tests. Be curious.

- Try the next level of preparation.

- Increase the speed of your first dictation.

- Raise the speed an extra time.

- Use a bigger jump between first and second dictation.

- Try something longer, with the same speed experiments.

- Follow Swem's advice and start with a fast dictation, so fast you cannot quite keep up, followed by a practically perfect one. You may find this approach works better as you master the theory. Switch when appropriate, or use a mix.

## Additional Advice

**Don't Rush, but Don't Stall**

It might take a chapter or two for an earlier chapter to sink in, but if that doesn't work do not hesitate to review older chapters.

**Difficult Words**

Do your best to record at least something for each word, and leave a gap for the correction. This will feel wrong at first, but most of the sentence with a hint for the word is better than missing the entire sentence. After the first dictation (or meeting), play with options for the word and, if you expect to need a reminder, record your favourite in the back of your notebook. (You'll be surprised how often you need a reminder.)

When you record spelling, note clearly whether it's correct or best-guess.

Avoid the temptation to make abbreviations. Shorthand speed comes from using the building blocks well, not creating abbreviations. (See section on Klein’s motion picture studies.)

Some writers leave larger margins and use a mark instead of a gap to mark needed corrections or spelling. Experiment.

**Relax**

Tension and aiming for perfection are the biggest causes of slow writing. Relax! (Yeah, saying Relax doesn’t work for me, either.)

Treat each attempt as an experiment, not a test. There is no pass/fail, just information about what type of practice to do next. It is ok to slow down for a bit if you pushed too hard, too fast, or you are having a bad week.

### Comparing Speeds

For now, the only reason to care about speed is to know what speed to attempt next and possibly bragging rights.

Your school, testing agency, or professional association will clearly define the rules for accuracy, duration, and type of material. They will have sample dictations to practice with. Check with them early enough that you have time to meet their standards. Some even offer proctored practice exams so you can become familiar with the entire testing process.

**Counting Words.** Gregg says 1 word is 1.4 syllables. Pitman says a word is a word. German shorthands count syllables, not words. (You'll know why if you speak German.) I don't know what different text reader programs use. For now, while speed is just a setting on your computer, use that.

**Accuracy.** Most professions care only about the transcript, not the shorthand. The only exception I found was UK Journalists, whose shorthand notes are sometimes used as legal evidence. Even then, the shorthand does not have to be perfect. It just has to support the transcript. Most teachers say a transcript that is 95% accurate passes. This includes formatting and typing accuracy. Professions, however, expect closer to perfection. 

Work on increasing your top speed at 95% or even 90% accuracy. That will increase your speed at 100% accuracy faster than working at slower speeds.

**Amount of Preparation.** Only your speed for unprepared material matters to your employer. Before that? Writing a page filled with notes to "look up rules" is a waste of time.

**Length of passage.** Speed goes down as length increases. Eventually you will write at close to the same speed for 5 minutes as for 1, but not yet.

**Steady vs Burst and Pause.** For now, take steady dictation. Practice with bursts and pauses once you reach 5 minute duration and close to professional speeds.

**Familiarity with the Material.** A parliamentary reporter is unlikely to have a brief form for "If it pleases the court."

**Type of Material.** Even a court reporter will struggle with poetry.

**Unusual Word and Names.** Those are usually provided separately and not included in the speed test. However, you should practice getting down enough that you can make a good guess the spelling.

Typical speeds: [UK journalists](https://www.holdthefrontpage.co.uk/2023/news/fewer-than-one-in-five-journalism-students-pass-100-wpm-shorthand/) needed 100wpm until 2016. [Toastmasters](https://www.toastmasters.org/magazine/magazine-issues/2021/sept/quit-talking-quickly) recommends 120-160 wpm. [California court reporters](https://www.courtreportersboard.ca.gov/applicants/information.shtml) need 200wpm for 13 minutes.


### Practicing Problem Areas

Watch your accuracy as you practice. At first it will get better, then plateau, then degrade. Stop when it plateaus. More practice after this point will do more harm than good unless you can refocus and write well again. Usually that is [five or fewer repetitions](#a-note-on-repetition).

Observe where you begin to fall behind in dictation. The problem outline may be a few words before that. Questionnaire and motion pictures studies by Klein (described later) show even expert writers do not know which outlines they write faster or slower.

Include a few words on either side of the problem. This will prevent hesitation as you approach a word that worries you.

Vary the speed. Slow helps precision. Speed helps fluency and reduces hesitation. You need both. If you made your own outline, consider changing it.

Our brains and bodies remember the first and final repeats more than the middle ones. They should be as fast as possible without losing readability.

“Anything that is dull and uninteresting is of doubtful pedagogic value. Also, excessive repetition generally results in progressive deterioration of the outlines practiced.” —  Gregg Shorthand Functional Method Teachers Handbook (1936). [stenophile.com](www.stenophile.com)

### Ruts and Plateaus

A rut is when the brain or body gets used to going a certain speed. Increasing speed beyond your capability and then slowing down will quickly break a rut. A plateau is when the brain or body simply cannot go faster until several new neural connections form. Trust that those connections are forming even if you see no difference. Keep the pressure on for speed, but also include a variety of speed, accuracy, and duration so those connections form properly. Eventually the last nerve will connect and your speed will increase suddenly.

 (Dr. Kenneth H Cooper, The New Aerobics, 1978, compares building muscle nerves and blood vessels to building new roads. The entire network must be finished before any of it can be used.) 

Be prepared to stall every time you increase the speed. Some increases will be worse than others. 

Push each passage as far as it will go, but do not waste time pushing it farther. Some are harder than others. (If more than one passage in five is hard, you are going too fast.) It is better to practice all the building blocks in a variety of combinations than to perfect a few. In the same vein, some are easier than others. Use these to practice going even faster.

Leslie recommends pushing all passages to 20% error rate. Swem recommends even faster when you need to break a rut. “Push the speed up to twice as fast as you can actually write it, and make an heroic effort to get something down for every word. It will not be good shorthand that you write, but it will serve to jar your hand out of its habit of sluggishness.” He warns not to attempt this before 140wpm, no more than once a month, and to “always end a session of this sort with a goodly amount of precision practice to offset the shattering tendencies of forced speed.”

The total repetitions for easy and hard passages will be about the same. The only difference is your final speed and accuracy. (That may change when you graduate from this course and move to Swem’s.)

## Building Endurance


Pratt endurance

Leslie -- easy material

pratt takes it one step farther.

Your speed will go down for longer passages. This is normal.

Long dictations require longer attention span, which you need to build. They penalize slow spots more (pen and brain); you can't catch up when the voice stops. Lastly, poor posture and tension and pen grip will start to become problems because you can't rest as often.

Those are all separate skills. Try exercises that work on each one separately. Often the skill we think isn't a problem is the one that's holding us back. Work on pen speed by writing the same 10-word sentence repeatedly for a minute (per Beryl Pratt). Work on brain speed by visualizing outlines without writing. Work on focus, posture and grip by writing longhand.

Think of other exercises and experiment!

Working at the edge of your ability means sometimes you'll over-shoot. Try to minimize this, and balance it with work that's a bit easier. When your penmanship starts to drop, try to bring it back, but don't reinforce bad habits for the sake of endurance until much later, when your penmanship is solid at speed.

Swem says to begin his Systematic Speed Course at 80-100wpm for 5 minutes, but until now you've mostly done shorter exercises. 

If your textbook has material keyed to each chapter, trust it. Dictation length will go up at a reasonable speed. Both Cricket's and Swem's methods for dictation practice will automatically adjust speed for easy or difficult passages. If you notice in advance that a passage is short, consider raising your key speeds to reach the top speed with fewer repetitions.

See Leslie's One Minute Speed Forcing Plan.

Blanchard's Pyramid is similar, but he uses only when increasing endurance, not to increase speed. Once you build to the longer dictations, you stay with them. "Mistakes in the last half are not due to lack of skill, but lack of endurance."  -- [Blanchard](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GeggQWEI2LNYZvffXmNsf7xvwiW73sJ1/view)

Leslie, as usual, has something else to say about endurance:

> It is true that there is no separate faculty of endurance. It is also true that speed is always conditioned by duration.

> [...]

> As the writer’s speed increases on dictations of short duration, he will also automatically increase in his ability to write lower speeds for longer durations. Thus the writer already cited could write 100 words a minute for 5 minutes and 120 words a minute for 2 or 3 minutes. When that writer can write 140 words a minute for 2 or 3 minutes, he will be able to write 120 words a minute for 5 minutes (by the skin of his teeth); but he will be able to write 100 words a minute for 7 or 8 minutes very comfortably. -- Leslie, Methods of Teaching Gregg Shorthand, page 309

Leslie's One Minute Speed Forcing Plan works on both speed for short dictations and endurance, but it slows your progress through the book. I recommend:



* 


passncreasing to every other 5th passage until you reach 8



 I recommend using it every few passages until you no longer need to write the entire passage before starting dictation, then for every other passage until you 



Alternate days of short and long dictations until your starting speed for 5 minutes is 80wpm and you are using the Swem's course with no modifications. Then reduce short dictations, but do not abandon them altogether.

After that, use the modified Swem's method.

If your long-dictation speed lags more than 20wpm below your short-dictation speed, use the pyramid again to prove that you can do the higher speed, then return to Swem's method.

Occasionally experiment with even longer dictations, to build more endurance.

Berryl Pratt, who is an accomplished Pitman writer and teacher, recommends writing the same 10-word sentence for an entire page.

### Professional Advice for Endurance

Leslie and Blanchard agree that speed will decrease as length increases, but not by how much.

| Leslie | Blanchard |
|--- |--- |
|--- |30s at 100wpm |
|2-3m at 120wpm |2m at 90wpm |
|5m at 100wpm |5m at 80wpm |
|10-15m at 60wpm |--- |

Beyond that? Advice varies.

Leslie recommends increasing speed on 1- and 2-minute dictations, which will automatically increase speed on longer dictations. He does not say how much to practice longer dictations, implying that we do not need to practice them at all. He believes lack of endurance is actually lack of speed.



Swem assumes you can already do 80wpm for 5 minutes, and says nothing about shorter passages.

None of them discuss dictation that changes speed, or the need to build mental endurance.

### Blanchard's Pyramid

Blanchard's example assumes students can write at 100wpm for 1 minute, proves to the students they can write for 5 minutes at 60wpm, then increases their speed to 80wpm for 5 minutes. 

The math gets a bit wonky if you start at a different speed. This chart assumes you have already read Blanchard's article, [Building Speed by the Pyramid Plan](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GeggQWEI2LNYZvffXmNsf7xvwiW73sJ1/view) .

| Step | 100wpm Start | 80wpm Start |
|--- |--- |--- |
|Target Speed| 80wpm | 60wpm |
|1 | Select easy 400 word passage, 5min at final speed |320 words |
|2 | Homework. Limited preparation. | Same. |
|3 | Review homework. | Same.|
|4 | Dictate at 60wpm for 5min = 300 words. | 40wpm, 200 words. |
|5 | Check work. | Same.|
|6 | 4 x 1/2min takes, 100wpm, 200 words | 80wpm, 160 words |
|7 | Same in single take, 90wpm | 70wpm |
|8 | Check work. | Same. |
|9 | Repeat step 6 for 2nd half. | Same.|
|10 | Repeat step 7 for 2nd half. | Same.|
|11 | Rest, then entire 400 word take at 80wpm. | 60wpm, 320 words |
|12 | Check work. | Same. |

The entire in-class procedure, after the homework, should take only 30 minutes.

You have now written a 5-minute passage at 20wpm less than your 1-minute speed. (It was 4 minutes at the faster speed, 5 at slower.)

It appears that Blanchard is ok with a high rate of errors for this passage.

Blanchard is very clear that the pyramid plan is only to be used when the gap between speeds for short and long dictations is too high. Go directly to a 5-minute take the rest of the time.

### Other Methods

* Beryl Pratt is an accomplished Pitman writer and teacher, and gives sensible advice: [Reddit/r/shorthand, June 6, 2025](https://www.reddit.com/r/shorthand/comments/1lmfiqn/approx_40_wpm_after_about_21_days_but_how_to/)

* More of Beryl's advice: [Reddit/r/shorthand, July 2, 2025](https://www.reddit.com/r/shorthand/comments/1lpvjtp/comment/n13ia20/?context=3)

* Take a 5-minute passage, lower your starting and practically perfect speeds by 20-40wpm each, and go for it. You'll soon learn what those speeds should be, the same way you learned when you started Swem's method for 1-minute passages. Build the speed for this length as usual.

* Use a 2-minute passage, lower your key speeds, and build as usual. Repeat with a 3-minute passage, then 4, then 5.

* As above, but use the same passage each time, just adding more to the end.

* As above, but add to the beginning, not the end, so you finish with your strongest material.

* As above, but repeat the same 1-minute material multiple times without pausing for a total of five minutes.

### Other Advice, Sometimes Contrary

Blanchard, Factors of Shorthand Speed.

- Vary daily plans, 5-day plan of theory, transcription, phrasing, sustained speed (concentration), and forcing speed.

- When you teach, teach instead of test.

- Increase the Student's power of concentration. Mistakes made during the 4th and 5th minutes are due to concentration, not shorthand knowledge. "Give the maximum number possible of 5-minute takes."

- Liberally preview material until 140wpm is reached. Use new matter for testing only. When you dictate new matter to students who cannot write more than 140 words a minute, you are testing, not teaching. (Compare to Swem who suggests 80wpm for no preview and fast initial attempt.)

- Only 3 dictations of previewed material, so the final is 20wpm above the initial. More will be necessary if material is not previewed.

### Comparison of Cricket's Course for Beginners to Swem's Course for Advanced Writers

Cricket's course is for building theory with a bit of speed. The first dictation is slow and full of mistakes because your brain is learning the theory and your hand is learning the shapes. The next dictation is usually more accurate even though it is faster, because your brain and hand now know the passage better. One of the dictations (overshoot) is faster than you expect to be accurate, to find problem areas and keep up the pressure.

Swem's course is for building speed once you know the theory. The first dictation is messy but readable. Your brain and hand know what to do, but can't do it at the requested speed.

### Modified Swem’s Systematic Speed Course for Intermediate Writers

When you are **confident with the theory**, move from Cricket's Beginner Sequence to Modified Swem's.

Read the [full article](swem-systematic-speed-course.md) for details.

Swem wrote his course for advanced writers, who could write new material at 80-100wpm for 5 minutes on their first attempt. Make the following adjustments until you reach that stage.

Keep a diary as before. Watch for changes, ruts and plateaus.

Swem uses speed descriptions, but does not give accuracies. I would say:
* highest speed at which you can write, for first attempt, "just get it down some way or another," = 90-95% accuracy
* practically perfect = 98% accuracy
* much better notes than you made on the first attempt = 95-98% accuracy
* highest speed at which you can make readable notes = 98% accuracy

Again, accuracy is measured by the transcript, not by the shorthand.

You should be able to make 100% accurate notes if you slow down just a bit more. That is your exam speed.

#### Weekly Plan

For reading, Swem recommends:
* 5x15=75 minutes on the manual, until you can apply the theory without hesitation at 125wpm.
* 2x30=60 minutes "practice new phrases and expedients" from advanced books -- clearly doesn't apply until you've mastered the first book.

I'd simplify that to alternating days.

For writing, Swem recommends using long passages only (remember he thinks you already built endurance):
* 5x40=200 minutes of fast/slow/build.
* 2x30=60 minutes on dictation as fast as you can make readable notes, with no repeats.

I'd simplify that to 3 days of fast/slow/build and 1 of readable notes with no repeats.

Continue with 1-minute dictations until you reach 80-100wpm for 1-minute, then build endurance as described elsewhere.

Alternate days (or dictations) of short/fast and long/slow dictations until your long speed reaches 80wpm for 5 minutes. At that point you are ready for Swem's course with no modifications.

### Unmodified Swem's Course

Even though Swem does not say to, you should continue to experiment on short fast and longer slow passages, in addition to the recommended 5-minute passages.

Increasing your 1-minute speed will help if the speaker's speed is erratic. Two dictations with the same average speed can have very different top speeds.

Increasing your endurance will prevent you from running out of steam after 5 minutes, especially if you are running behind. The (Gregg) Expert Shorthand Speed Course recommends 10 minutes dictations to prepare for a 5-minute competition.

## Motion Picture Study by Klein

Leslie reports on a motion picture study by Klein. Experts took dictation at 220wpm for five minutes. “Good school learners” took dictation at 140wpm. They also answered a questionnaire. (Methods of Teaching Gregg Shorthand)


“Of the three experts, Dupraw and Rifkin were better able than Swem to tell with what relative speeds they wrote the combinations. When the total number of instances and occurrences of all the combinations is used, it is seen that Dupraw was right in approximately half the instances; Rifkin, in seven-tenths of the instances; and Swem in but one-fifth of the instances.”

All writers’ pens moved at approximately the same speed while writing. The difference in overall speed was in the time spent not writing. The learners’ pen speed was 333-440wpm, with as little as 31-42% of the time spent actually writing. The experts’ pen speed was 417-447, with 47-53% of the time spent writing.

“The students paused about five times as frequently as the experts in writing the combinations of this study.”

There was no consistency between number vs length of individual pauses between experts, only in the total time paused.

> In one 10-second section of the film, Swem, who as stated before, is constantly analyzing his writing processes, paused 11 times, whereas Dupraw, who seldom attempts to analyze his writing habits, paused but 3 times.
>
> Thus the one expert, taking dictation at 220 words a minute, 80 words a minute faster than the dictation of the learner, wrote with a pen speed of only 415 words a minute, compared with the pen speed of 451 words a minute of Learner No. 3, taking dictation at 140 words a minute."

## Final Words

I hope this advice will help. Let me know how it goes and if you would recommend any changes.

### Shorthand Groups

Often a study buddy, penpal, or mentor a few levels above you can make a big difference. Many groups have a quote of the day or week, where you can see and discuss how different writers handle the same passage. Comparing methods and abbreviations from other systems, in moderation, can help you understand yours better.

Advice on when to start creating your own shorthand from text or dictation varies. If your book is modern and has instructions, follow them. If your book does not have much material, the choice is made for you! Some older books say to only write from well-written shorthand until you have finished the theory. Most modern books divide it evenly: Half the exercises in each chapter begin by reading well-written shorthand, and half begin by writing shorthand from the text. Even books that come with a CD for dictation say to write the material a few times, and build a minimum speed, before attempting dictation, except perhaps for a few exercises with familiar words in new sentence at very slow speeds.
