    This method claims that its well-proven success was due to the reading-only approach. Students delay writing for 20 lessons, by which time they have seen hundreds of well-written outlines and know all the basic shapes. Then they read and copy for a week while their hands get past the "initial diffuse movements." They read, copy and take dictation of prepared material until the theory is finished. Only then do they start new matter dictation and endurance. 

    I'm not sure if the success was due to the was the long delays, or the other differences. The book had significantly more graded material than other Gregg books at the time (unless your board was willing to buy supplementary books). The handbook also had much advice on how to introduce new words, handle questions, hold the focus on writing instead of memorizing rules, keep the lesson lively, and use as much class time as possible on dictation.

A comparison of a reading approach with a reading-writing approach to the learning of shorthand
Abercrombie, William Thomas

Several factors mitigated against a successful experiment. First, a start was made with too few matched pairs, because when the groups were given their final test only 14 matched pairs could be used. Secondly, disturbing factors such as truancy, illness, and laziness interfered with some of the students' application to their studies. In a large group, these influences probably would have balanced out, but in a small group, they tended to invalidate the test results. Although the study did not prove one method of approach to the learning of shorthand to be superior to another, still it is to be hoped that further experimentation will be carried on with a view to reducing the learning time of Pitman Shorthand, so that the student will learn to use this vocational tool in the shortest possible time.

Evaluation of First-Year Shorthand Achievement. Final Report
By Judith Lambrecht
ABSTRACT 
Pretests and dictation achievement tests were 
administered-to 1,317 first-year shorthand students and 120 
second-year students learning Century 21, Forkner, or Gregg shorthand 
in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area high schools. Forkner shorthand' 
students achieved a higher 
accuracy and transcription rate during.the 
first year of instruction. Thus, it is suggested that this is the 
preferred method of instruction for studentg who are able to devote , 
one year or less to shorthand instruction. However, by the end of the 
second year Gregg shorthand s 
bad higher accuracy scores and 
better. English error scores, suibg,that this is the preferred 
method for students who are able to tak wo years of shorthand 
instruction. None of the three shor 
nd systems included in this 
project resulted'in first-year shorthand achievement at vocational 
skill levels, assuming that maifable letters from dictation at 80 
words per minute represents inilum vocational skill. 
(Complete data 
tables are included.) (BB)

dropouts the same for all 3 systems
no C21 in 2nd yr class
Half the Gregg students continued; teacher told some they couldn't
31% Forkner continued

Smith {20) summarized the following conclusions based on
his study:
(l) The Forkner Alphabet Shorthand System is easier to
learn than the Gregg Shorthand System. This conclusion
is based on the fact that when comparing systems and
achievement, Forkner achieved significantly higher than Gregg.
(2) The learning progress of first year Forkner Alphabet Shorthand students is greater than the learning progress of Gregg students.
(3) The Forkner Alphabet Shorthand System is better adapted than the Gregg Shorthand System to the above average,
average, and below average student.
(4) In one year of shorthand, Forkner excels in superiority
over the Gregg system. Three sets of dictation were
used and the findings were compared not only between
systems, but also with comparison to grade point
average of similar nature in both groups.
