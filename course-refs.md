The author lists Gregg Functional, but not whether it's Anniversary or Simplified. Simplified Functional was published in 1949. It's unlikely the classes would have access to the new manual, so I assume the study was on the Anniversary version.

    This method claims that its well-proven success was due to the reading-only approach. Students delay writing for 20 lessons, by which time they have seen hundreds of well-written outlines and know all the basic shapes. Then they read and copy for a week while their hands get past the "initial diffuse movements." They read, copy and take dictation of prepared material until the theory is finished. Only then do they start new matter dictation and endurance. 

    I'm not sure if the success was due to the was the long delays, or the other differences. The book had significantly more graded material than other Gregg books at the time (unless your board was willing to buy supplementary books). The handbook also had much advice on how to introduce new words, handle questions, hold the focus on writing instead of memorizing rules, keep the lesson lively, and use as much class time as possible on dictation.

Worth exploring the entire site. Advice useful for all systems is included in many of the Pitman lessons. Some of the shorthand passages with keys also contain useful advice. Her writing is beautiful. It does not look exactly like the book, but each shape is very clear.
