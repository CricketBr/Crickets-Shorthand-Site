First Few Dictations



For your first dictation, use Pratt's 10 Word Copying Method until your pen is happy, then Leslie's One Minute Speed Forcing Plan. Start with 20wpm and 10wpm steps for your first 10-word passage. Try starting with 30wpm for your second passage, then combine first and second as Leslie describes. Use 30 or 40wpm to start your third and fourth passages, and combine them as Leslie describes.

You have now written 40 words at 40wpm or higher.



 Stay with that or increase to 40wpm for your third and fourth. Then combine

For your second passage, try starting with 30wpm, and 40wpm for your third and fourth.


Write the first 10 words several times, until your pen is happy with it (Pratt 10-Word Method), then take dictation using the first steps of Leslie's One Minute Speed Forcing Plan, using 10wpm steps. For your first passage, start with 20wpm and do a few more repetitions. For your second passage, try starting with 30wpm. If it felt easy, increase to 40wpm for your third. Continue Leslie's program until you combine four 10-word 







All exercises are written in shorthand at least once before dictation. If the book has shorthand, copy that.

Use the first steps of Leslie's One Minute Speed Forcing Plan to build speed, so your final speed is at least 40-60 wpm for 1 minute, within a few sessions. Then keep a bit of pressure on. Aim to finish the theory and reach 60-80 for your final speed within 1 semester (40 min/class, 20 classes/month, 4 month/semester = 53 hours in class, plus equal time at home). If you can go faster, then do so, but not at the expense of finishing the theory.

Only write material from the book until you finish the theory. Even then, fully write each exercise until your pen is happy with it before dictation. Start transitioning to less preparation when you can write 95% of new material without hesitation. Then read the material and practice unfamiliar words until you are comfortable writing new words from scratch, before moving to the next stage.







Pratt's 10 Word Sentences is also useful at any stage when you want to force your pen to go faster.

Pratt's 10 Word Method Easy Intro to Dictation

> For an easy intro to dictations, you can use just one easy sentence but repeated say five times in a single sound file, to make a longer "passage", in order to remove outline recall obstacles and just get used to the dictation scenario of having to write without hesitation...You can do the same without a sound file, just write the same sentence down the page, and by the time you get to line 20, you feel you've gone from snail to racehorse, gets the juices going and the cobwebs gone.

Making Shorthand Teaching Effective 
BY JOHN ROBERT GREGG
(A paper read before the Eastern Commercial Teachers' Association)
1921, Gregg Publishing Company

P4 I believe that the remedy is simply this: to teach students to write shorthand *rapidly and accurately* from the first, instead of teaching them to write shorthand *slowly and carefully*.

p14
I believe the answer is to be found,
as it is in the case of penmanship, in the statement that the teachers keep
before the students from the beginning
the end to be attained^ and that is rapidity as well as accuracy. They start the
student right; they see that the posture
is right; that the method of doing the
work is right; that the student is kept
alert and enthusiastic from the very
first day and all through the course; above all, they aim to eliminate every
false motion.





16
The point I am trying to make is that the way to make shorthand teaching more effective is to drill the students
in correct habits from the hegi^ining, and
The Teaching of Shorthand 17
that we must keep before them the idea of
rapidity of execution.

17
In teaching shorthand we have given
too Httle thought to the right posture
and to the development of swift, effortless writing from the beginning. Many
teachers place such emphasis on slow,
careful writing that the hahit of slow
movement is fastened on the student.
Afterwards, in the advanced work, the
student finds it difficult, and sometimes
impossible, to overcome the sluggish,
painfully precise style thus acquired.
He has no facility in "getting around
corners,'* as it were. Under pressure
his notes go to pieces, just as the penmanship of the "copybook" penmanship student went to pieces when
rapidity was required.





Continue to fully prepare all passages until you have mastered the theory and your penmanship is legible when written just faster than comfortable. (19 words out of 20 correct on first attempt, and something readable for the words you don't know.) Then reduce preparation to only practicing words you expect to be a problem. (Reduce starting speed to compensate.) Then, finally, stop preparation altogether.

Legible = Someone familiar with your writing, or yourself in six months, can read it, although it might take two attempts.

For each passage past the first few, when your hand is fairly comfortable with the new shapes, challenge yourself by increasing one thing slightly: Starting speed, top speed, final speed, or duration. All other numbers should be comfortable. Occasionally push one number much farther than is comfortable and see what happens.

While you are still learning the theory, focus on theory and slowly building speed and duration.

Once you finish the theory and your penmanship is reliable, start pushing harder -- but still only one aspect for each passage. Switch half your dictation time to "mailable transcript," slow enough that you can focus on penmanship, but only one attempt, and type it the next day during typing class. (Trust me, typing it a day later, or at least reading it out loud, makes a huge difference.)




, practice problem areas, then take dictation with a textbook or clean copy in front of you. (You will naturally stop looking at the sample as your speed increases. Don't force it.)
