Manual vs Direct
manual/functional better than direct -- but what is direct?
use of blackboard!!

Functional better in all ways except brief forms in first few months
BUt...
advanced class shows opposite in first test, afer vacation
(easy enough ti fix) thoery: drill of manual type new to fn group so it would be more effecive,
speed of transcription much higher with fn

Direct method: genrealization from other words

Leslie functional 761 pages of shorthand; next highest 558, only after combining with gregg manual and speed studies

p69
functional better in all ways
esp
formal penmanship drills not beneficial
class time for practice, not quesitons to/from students
formal testing harmful
writign word lists no help
copying outlines or connected matter numberous times no help
no review of principles nec at end of yr bec review takes place naturally by frequent recurrenc of common words

**"The success of any method depends on the skill and enthusiasm of the teacher."**

p71 as above and
do not memorize rules
blackboard!
prompt promptly when necessary for speed building
mix of activities
encourage pupils by allowing on lsuccessful experiences
