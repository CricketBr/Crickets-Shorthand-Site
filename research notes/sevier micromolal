both approaches effective, no dif in 3 minute new matter dictation tests

Shorthand I class, high school
60 minute periods, 5/wk, entire year -- but study was only 1st quarter
-- 3 minutes new matter after only that long??
immediate transcription
DJS -- so lots of matrial in book
partial preview and practice

Early New-Matter Method

- tracing on oninskin paper, 6 wks, as homework to be turned in
- accordion method for brief forms
- new matter dictation practice as son as learned second list of brief forms, very simple matter, mostly brief forms
- slow enough that all can get it
- then slow 3 minute takes
- formal review homeowork for lesson 1 assigned when 21 is assigned
- use key diong homework
- every 6th lesson is only reading for speed
- hwk - trace lesson for 1st 6 weeks. write lesson for remainder of course, according brief forms, writing review lessons 3x, readinng for speed

micromolar

- constant practice rate -- 100wpm throughout the semester
- all at this rate except test material
- controlled reader for constant speed in reading and writing
- tracing material for much of the material dictated in class for 1st 6 wks, not or testing
- hw - read over and over until rapidly and with ease
- early intro to writing, on lesson 4, material from lesson 3 dictated, at 100wpm, ony 10-15 s
- other proecedures similar to tradl
rules of theory presented but not stressed
word lists used but little emphasis, major cohncern is continuous material
key parovided for hw
brief form drills
formal review of theory at regular intervfals
hw for first semester mostly resding assigned lesson



grrr, changed several things! between groups


++
report on study by schloemer, reading/functional vs writing with much eveidence on rules of theory
end of class, 3min dictation, equal results

Settle, difference but insig

++
early new matter vs reading
writer found studies disagreed
Ward -- early new matter helped, esp for suller students
Persing -- opposite results -- no sig dif

micromolar theory -- each speed is a different skill, need to learn shorthand multiple times

suggests easy material at high speed, instead of difficult at low
Sloan -  control group practiced variety of speeds, test at only 100, for practice and tests

test 4 times over 12 wks
ctrl: 50wpm, 60, 70, 80 tests
test: all at 100
material?

at 12 wks: battery of 3-min tests vareity fo speeds

first three test, tradl methd superior
fourth test same results

Recommend: longer experiment and slower speed for the test group

Boss, college students: expt better on 1st 2 interim, ctrol on the remainder; ctrl gp didn't improve during last 2 wks, explt group did
no sig acheivement -- lots of details of expt not listed

New expt:

A: beginning new matter at 20wpm, each day antoher new-matter letter, with word privew and pracice
various plans for speedbuilding -- dictation same speed vary length; vary rate keep lentgh; vary both; what htey call pyramid but actually leslie first steps up, down.


B: 100wpm constant, no writing outside of class except tracing -- control speed
2 types tracing plates: start with copy of prev days lesson, dicate 10-15 sec and trace
later, 1 sentence repeated 5 times.
complicated method of leaving out words dictated, filing them in -- what???? Why????
only time not at this speed were the tests


testing on 3 min new matter every week, much practice dictation on other days
end of st wk, test dictate to all at 20, 30, 40 
final 5 takes, 40 50 60 70 80



Badly designed!!
