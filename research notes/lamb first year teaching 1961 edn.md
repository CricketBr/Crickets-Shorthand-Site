Tentative goals
After the first year of shorthand (elementary shorthqand in the first semester and dictation practice in the second semester), students should:
-- is this like my high school, 110 hours spread over 2 semesters, or the kids' with 110 hours each semester??

1. Be able to read familiar plate material and shorthand notes of common matter at a rate from 100 to 150 words a minute.

2. Be able to write legible shorthand notes.

3. Be able tor ecord practiced matter at a rate of 80-100 word a minkute and record new matter of average difficulty dictated at a rate of 60-80 words a minute for a period of five minutes.

4. Be able to transcribe these notes in longhand or on the typewriter with a minimum rate of 15-20 words a minute, with a five per cent error allowance.

5. dictionary, grammar, ref books
6. attitude, toward others
7. attitude toward work


At the end of the advanced phase of training, with one daily period assigned to shrothand, one daily period assigned to transcription, and at least one hour spent each day on out-of-school prepration, students shoudl be able to:

1. Record practiced matter dictated at 100-120 words a minute for five minutes and new matter of avrage difficulty dictated at 80-100 worda a minute.

2. Transcribe 15-25wpm, first try

p25, no maps, games, pictures, films -- time on skill-building instead, daily routine

graded on transcript only, not beauty of notes or mastery of theory
-- this is against Pullis!!!

Pullis -- soem teachers mark both notes and transcript, max error for each. Others just mark transcript, but read notes to see if pblm is notes or transcr. Others only look at transcr -- ingoring where the problem starts.

26
Students should learn what to do when they encounter a word they cannot read: to spell the word as it appears, to consider possible mistakes in proportio for a brief moment, to read the sentence entirely to get total meaning and to substitute a word to complete meaning if necessary.

-- I add column method and consider that other words in sentence might be wrong

Read in thought units.

Relationship of Speed to Accuracy

fluency and speed, accuracy dceveloped as a refinement of the skill achieved through practice

accuracy first, speed later is wrong

-- but!!! overdone is also wrong!!! middle way

Early fluency and speed are followed by a drop-back for control.
AKA
Practice for control is a follow-up of eaerly efforts aimed at fluency or speed -- efforts that give the learner the "feeling of the skill."

repetitive practice of easy material when pushign students to new speed levels. You are aiming at the eventual control of the new writing rate and this is a physical development that should not be blocked by the introduction of new outlines that will cause hesitation in recording.

When a new speed level is achieved with reasonable accuracy (five per cent error allowance), the teacher starts to drive beyond the recently established level for a speed ten or twenty words a minute higher. With practice, this speed willyield to control.

speed -- won't read back notes with ease and accuracy
for oral or written transcription, within contgrold writing rate of the class

most prctice shoudl be successful practice. Confidence!
break routinein to short eaacy steps
familiar to unfamiliar
simple to complex

spell outlines aloud as write them on the board -- for entire first semester

she likes functional method

-- Pullis, book open -> copy shapes

functional method (no rules), traditional (rules stated as rules, conciously applied, practiced as rules in word lists and contextual matter). Trad includes memorized or not, learned inductively or deductively
-- I say blend!

-- one Gregg book goes to great extreme, words -> rules

Pullis -- word lists are necessary
42
grading stuents on the appearance of their outlines no longer considered good practice even in traditional-method teaching. Legibility is the standard for notes, regardless of teaching method used; and penmanship drills, when given are better deferred for 5-6wks -- aquire real fluency before refining through remedial drills

trad methd is a "parts method", indirect because learn therouh rules rathe rthan imiitation involving word-recognition and word-writing

deducitve start with rule, then application. Inductive starts with examples tha lead to the formulation of the rule

inductive takes longer, but teaches reasoning ability, observation -- good skills, but in moderation

whole unit in reading -- experts disagreee -- word or sentence as a unit.
Lamb uses whole words
learn and practfrice in framework of sentence and paragraph
downside -- lose track of the meaning because working on parts
-- but as we've seen, whole-word often reads the word wrong

-- I believe build up the parts, and practice the wholes

functional is a combination of whole and parts

"Probably all teachers would agree that certainly the teaching of rules should be incidental to the practrfice of reading and writing shorthand -- that is, that much more time should be spent in reading and writing shrothand than in consdieratio of rules.


she quotes leslie

read shorthand
copy
dictation of material already read and copied
- soem add print to shorthand
dication easy previewd
easy not previewed
new not previewd

print->shorthand -- doesn't work on fluency, can stop to think, 
but...is stopping to build a word soemties a problem? It's a stept twoards building them quickly

she quotes anderson, text->shorthand better, since not just copying shapes
55
size of outline -- too large = uncontrolled; want  small and controlled

56
There seems to be rather general agreement that fluency is an objective in early reading and writing, but that rates of speed shoudl not be forced until students have acquired a substantial skill. HOever, students should be led to read and write at fair rates from the beginning so they do not develop habits of hesitation and undue deliberation.

Students should know how to apply the rules of writing, evne though they never learn the rules verbatim.

Reading and writing contextual matter is almost always beter practice than reading and writing word lists.

correct, repetitive practice!!

Types of Dictation Practice
If you will study the teacher's manual for your textbook, you
will understand the objectives for each part of the lesson and
you will find that there are various purposes for dictation practice ,
some of them overlapping :
1. Dictation for transcription . This dictation calls for properly
selected new-matter dictation familiar words and phrases
in new settings , with only an occasional new word -
dictated at the average writing rate of the class . The aim
of the dictation is to ensure legibility of notes and accurate
transcription in longhand or on the typewriter , according
to the length of the training program and the preference of
the teacher .
2. Automatization of common words and phrases . Some
dictation should be given every day to promote automatization of high -
frequency outlines . Highfrequency matter is
dictated at increasing speeds after the teacher is sure that
the students are writing correct outlines .
3. Development of word -building power . Some dictation
should be given every day to develop word -building power ,
and this dictation should be given at a slower rate than
easier dictation . As the notes are read back, the teacher
places the outlines for new and troublesome words on the
board , allows time for practice of these words , and then
redictates the matter two or three times .
Dictation of word lists develops word -building power if the
words are similar in construction , involving the same rule
of writing , or if they derive from a common root . Practice
of such word lists should be followed by practice of the
words in context .
4. Development of recording speed . Only practiced matter
from which all difficulties have been removed is used for
speed building ; the rate of dictation is determined by a
speed-building plan understood by teacher and pupils .
5. Improvement of writing techniques and notebook habits .
Only practiced matter should be dictated when the purpose
of the dictation is improvement in the ways of taking
dictation , and the rate of dictation should be easy for the
majority of the class .
6. Development of sustained power . Occasionally it is a good
idea to give dictation at a moderate rate for an entire
period ; later , introduce short spurts of speed .

7. Development of word-carrying ability. "Spurt" dictation
that requires the writers to carry an unusual number of
words in mind as they write challenges the students' powers
of concentration and develops their ability to carry words
in memory while writing.
Students should understand the purposes of specific "takes"
and they should always know the rate of dictation at which they
are writing.

Strony explains her ten-point improvement program in her
speed-building work throughout the shorthand program:
1. I used easy material for speed-building. Oh, yes, I did
give them some difficult work at times, but I taught the
students how to dash off the easy words. In that way
they had more time to write the more difficult ones.
2. I previewed all the dictation for speed-building.
3. I advocated that they keep writing - writing by sound.
In other words, they did not stop to try to recall the word
as it appeared in the book (if they did not already know
it).
4. Each day I forced their speed, but I was sure that it was
not too fast. I did not want the students to become
frustrated.


ADVANCED SHORTHAND / 85
5. After forcing the speed, I had the students write for
control so that their notes would not stay shattered.
Furthermore, my students understood the principle
behind the forcing and the control.
6. In my speed-building activity, I concentrated on many
short takes (one-half minute, one minute to two minutes)
instead of many five-minute takes. These takes would
be given over and over again. Sometimes I dictated a
given letter as much as four or five times.
7. I did not try to change my students' writing habits.
I let them write the way they normally wrote. So long as
proportion and fluency are maintained, the student will
progress in building shorthand speed.
8. I laid the groundwork for typewritten transcription by
introducing oral transcription rather early in the course
(about the sixth week of the first semester). This oral
transcription included spelling, punctuation, vocabulary,
and understanding of meaning.
9. Their outside practice had meaning because we read from
these notes sometimes from last night's notes, last
week's, or occasionally last month's. We never took
more than about two or three minutes a day doing this
it was kept peppy and snappy because they wrote notes
that could be read back quickly.
10. I kept my students relaxed. Not by saying 'Now relax,'
but by creating a working situation that would enable
them to relax by challenge and cheeriness, by com-
mendation and enthusiasm, by the right amount of drill
given in the right way.5


begin and end each day with success -- warm up, then end with moderate speed

gives Leslie's one minute, look like numbers in his eg

Flood presents a less intensive plan requiring a few minutes
each day:
Part of the difficulty encountered in pushing students to the
higher rates stems from their lack of confidence in their ability
to read their notes written at high rates. Overemphasis on
accuracy of outlines increases this hesitancy. A method that
has been found successful in overcoming this lack of con-
fidence and in giving a feeling of success both of which are
very essential in any skill building is the use of progressive
short timings on easy material containing high-frequency
words and phrases. The material must have low syllabic
intensity. The technique provides for a few minutes' practice
each day and progresses in this manner:
-
-
First day Dictate letter at 40, 60, 80, and drop back the
fourth take to the initial speed for the day. Student is urged
to keep writing, even though he may have to leave out parts
of the dictation.
Second day- Dictate the same letter at 60, 80, 100, and drop
back to 60. Again, he is urged to practice on the letter at
home and keep trying, even though the highest rate is beyond
his ability.

CH. 5/
ADVANCED SHORTHAND / 89
Third day Dictate the letter at 80, 100, 120, and drop
back to 80. Each day, the final take is given at the lowest rate
for the day. This plan gives the student an opportunity to
refine his notes, which will build his confidence, and at the
same time it gives him a feeling of success.
Fourth day - Start at 100, 120, 140, and drop back to 100.
Fifth day Start at 120, and build up to 160. Then drop
back to 120 or even 100. Call the attention of the students to
the fact that they have increased their rate on that letter
40 or 60 words per minute, as the case may be. Assign another
letter for the following week so that the difficult parts can
be practiced at home.
As the students increase their writing rate, the initial speed
on Monday will be increased.7


--- sometimes go back and do a previous one -- but same one every day for a week, getting this fast? ouch

--- do the alphabet exercise
--- test row of same letter vs alphabet

leave a gap, get a few letters -- and do it before you get so far behind that you can't fiull in the gap from context

--- penmanship drills -- suggest the rwriting ones and zigzag, not separate shapes (my note, not lambs)

ask dictator to slow down rather than make notes that take more time to transcribe
