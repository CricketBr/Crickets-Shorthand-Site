Cricket's Shorthand Tips
: A collection of tips I've accumulated over the years.

Cricket's Shorthand Lessons
: A series of steps and guildelines for how to progress when learning shorthand, especially if you don't have a teacher to help guide you.

Orthic Consolidated Series
: The original Orthic books are a mess. Callendar wrote the Manual, then a year later instead of issuing one with the rules (mostly advanced rules moved to intermediate, but at least one change of meaning), he wrote the Supplement . Stevens then wrote Teaching Parts 1 and 2, which is a series of lessons saying which part of the Manual and Supplement to read for each lesson, and adds/moves more rules. 10 years later, in Australia, Clarey issued Revised Extended and Improved, which combines all the above, but also makes his own changes -- some of which conflict with the earlier books.

Orthic Consolidated Reference Alphabet
: A consolidation of the letter and joining rules for all four original books, with images, and source of rules clearly marked for reference. This is useful when the books don't agree. Reporting level only partially included. If a rule introduces a new shape, it goes here.

Orthic Consolidated Reference Abbreviations
: A list of all the abbreviations and word parts from the four original books. Images aren't required. Includes searchable standard and Orthic spelling. If someone who knows the alphabet and joining rules, and can create an outline given the Orthic spelling, it goes here. Reporting level only partially included.

Orthic Consolidated Vocabulary
: A list of all the words from all four sources, again only partially including Reporting level. This will help people look up examples of the rules.
