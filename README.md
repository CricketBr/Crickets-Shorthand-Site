Finally! All in one place, with URLs that make sense.

Still a work in progress. Plans will probably change.

**[Cricket's Shorthand Tips](cr-shorthand-tips.md)**

A collection of tips I've accumulated over the years. Replaced by Cricket's Shorthand Course.

**[Cricket's Shorthand Course](cr-shorthand-course.md)**

A series of steps for learning shorthand, especially if you don't have a teacher to guide you.

**[Orthic Consolidated Reference  -- In Progress](orth-cnsl-ref.md)** 

An attempt to organize the all the Orthic rules into a single document for reference. The four Orthic books were written by three different authors on two continents. Instead of issuing a revised manual, books 2 and 3 (Supplement and Teaching) only show changes to the system. They move rules around, add some, and change other. The 4th (Revised) is the complete system but has some significant differences.

This book combines all the rules from all the earlier books, except some that are only in the Reporting Style. It is *not* intended as an introduction to Orthic. The Manual or Revised is best for that. (I recommend the Manual, and anything Revised does differently just feels wrong to anyone who started with the Manual.)

Hopefully it creates more clarity than confusion.

**The Hobbit Learns Orthic -- Not started**

A set of lessons based on Tolkein's The Hobbit, progressing from Fully Written to Supplement/Correspondence Style. The order of presentation will be "as needed." In theory that will cover most of the useful rules at a reasonable pace.

**[The Orthic Hobbit -- Barely started](orth-hobbit.md)**

A crowd-sourced version of The Hobbit, written in whatever styles the contributors prefer. (Contributions welcome!)

**Licencing**
