# The Orthic Hobbit

A Crowd-Sourced Project to Write The Hobbit in Orthic Shorthand.
{: .subtitle}

Copyright: Sort of silly, since The Hobbit is still under copyright everywhere.. xxx Find an actual statement, GNU? MIT? Personal use copies fine. Distribution include link to original. If I disappear for more than a year, International Shorthand Society Discord to decide what to do with it.

I take no responsibilty for:
- accuracy of shorthand. I'm not that good!
- people making and sharing copies of your contributions. They're not supposed to do it, but I have no way to enforce it.

## Introduction

Orthic shorthand is a good first shorthand for most people. It is quick to learn at the Fully Written Style (write each letter using “the common orthography”) and multiple levels can be used in a single sentence without confusion. Based on stroke counts, its speed potential is comparable to other office and personal use shorthands. The other levels are even faster. Multiple levels can be used in the same sentence without confusion.

The biggest problem is lack of modern reading material. It has plenty of older material -- KJV Psalms and New Testament -- but those are hard to read in the standard alphabet, before adding shorthand.

This project will help people find reading material.

## Contributions

All are welcome, regardless of skill.

The image of each page should include:
- chapter and line numbers.
- revision number or date if appropriate.
- name of writer.
- style or level, so the reader knows what to expect. Most rules are optional, so most contributions will be a mix of levels.
- type of comments requested.\
ACW = All Comments Wanted.\
CCW = Constructive Comments Wanted.
- a few words in longhand or print at the beginning of the 1st line.

## Comments and Accuracy

We will make a reasonable effort at accuracy, but no promises.

Proof-reading another writer’s work, looking up rules if needed, is a good way to review the theory.

Send all comments to cricket@onebit, or one of the addresses on https://cricketbr.github.io/Crickets-Shorthand-Site/ .

All useful comments will be sent to the writer. Corrections will be added to the site in a way that makes sense at the time. Writers will *not* be expected to rewrite the entire page!

## Abbreviations

As the project grows, I'll make a list of standard abbreviations for non-English words. Some words will have more than one. It’s fun to see experiments, and why you chose the one you did.

Until then, pick one of:

- Write the abbreviations and longhand in the margin or at the bottom of the first page in each group you submit.

- Make a separate master list of all abbreviations in the current group.

- Make a separate master list of all abbreviations for all your work.

## Passage Reservation

Reservation is optional. If you want to reserve a section, so people can avoid overlap if they want to, let me know and I'll put it here. Try to reserve only what you'll finish in a few weeks.
