Introduction
Orthic shorthand is a good first shorthand for most students. It is quick to learn at the Fully Written Style (write each letter using “the common orthography”) and multiple levels can be used in a single sentence without confusion. Based on stroke counts, its speed potential is comparable to other office and personal use shorthands. The other levels are even faster. Multiple levels can be used in the same sentence without confusion.
This project will help students find reading material.
Style or Level will be chosen by each contributor, and stated clearly. Some submissions will have a combination of styles.

Accuracy
We will do our best – which is not perfect. Please email corrections to cricket@onebit.ca  or contact me at the International Discord Society.
Comments and corrections will be handled in a variety of ways. I will put a note on the index page describing the correction, or showing a link to a discussion elsewhere. Writers can incorporate the comments in any way they like and resubmit, or let it stand as is.
As a side note: Proof-reading another writer’s work, looking up rules if needed, is a good way to review the theory.
Levels and Styles
Keep it simple. State the most recent book you used, and which level within that book. You can ignore rules that are used so rarely they’re not worth memorizing, or include a few rules from higher levels that save (what’s left of) your sanity. If you use a mix, then say so.
Readers will have the key.
Format
These Guidelines assume each submission will be a single image. If yours is longer, then do something sensible to balance your work with making it easy for readers to find what they need, and for me to keep things organized.
We are using the text at https://github.com/jblazzy/LOTR/blob/master/hobbit-chapters .
At the top of each page, print “The Othic Hobbit”, the chapter, starting line number, style, and your name. This information will go in the index.
Every 5-10 lines, put the line number in the margin, so readers can use the key easily. A few words in print would also help. (This will be less important for simpler styles and later pages in the same style.)
If you want to use an abbreviation for non-English words, print the text beside the abbreviation at the bottom of the first page of the passage. This will keep it consistent. (There is no harm in putting it in more places.)
I will make a master list of submitted abbreviations. Some words will have more than one. It’s fun to see experiments, and why you chose the one you did.
Passage Selection
All writers are encouraged to do the first few paragraphs, so we can see the same words in different handwriting and styles. Past that, it’s up to you if you want to tell the world what you’re working on (to avoid duplication) or wait. If you let me know, I’ll add it to the index page.
