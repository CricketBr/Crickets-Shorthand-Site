Keep it short for this, just the Orthic spelling and refer to Consolidated Reference.

Maybe a table? beginning, middle, end?

table of mode ?

Or just list the letters, and subheading under each for mode, prefix, etc

Last idea probably best.


Need "nothing in front", eg be, they-phrases

Orthic letters
- prefix
  - no gap
  - mode 1
  - mode 2
  - mode 3
- middle
  - no gap
  - mode 1
  - mode 2
  - mode 3
- suffix
  - no gap
  - mode 1
  - mode 2
  - mode 3


Nope, too much work for links. Include example for easy lookup.

start the doc with link to ref
