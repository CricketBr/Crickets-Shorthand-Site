# Introduction

Orthic shorthand is a good first shorthand for most students. It is very quick to learn at the Fully Written Level, and multiple levels can be used in a single sentence without confusion.

The Fully Written level simply replaces each letter with a single-stroke equivalent, and provides “joins” to combine letters that otherwise do not work well together. You do not need to relearn how to spell or to guess at letters that were left out. It reduces stroke count down to ??? compared to longhand cursive, which increases writing speed by ??? . This math says that speeds of ?? or higher are possible – but speedbuilding with this set of rules is not advised.

Excessive practice at the Fully Written level will train your hand and brain to write fully – even when it’s not necessary. Do the exercises as described, so you are 80% comfortable with the alphabet (even if you have to look up letters and combinations), then move to Abbreviated.

The Abbreviated level simplifies spelling and adds optional (but highly recommended) rules for abbreviations and endings. At first there were very few rules, but later publications added more. The rules are standardized so that it can be used in correspondence. Note: Orthic does not distinguish between shortened words, prefixes, and suffixes. They are all called abbreviations. The author of The Teaching of Orthic Shorthand claims you can reach 60wpm after finishing the 9 week program (and doing a mere 15 minutes a day of homework).

The final level, Reporting, is more optional rules. Some of these were promoted to Abbreviated in later publications.

The existing publications have a few deficiencies:
- Rules are spread out over too many publications. Instead of printing a revised Manual, they printed a Supplement, and a Teaching booklet, and then, finally, Clarey revised the manual.
- Minimal guidance for studying.
- Insufficient material at each chapter. Some rules may not appear in the passages chosen.

This guide addresses the first problem. [Cricket’s Shorthand Tips](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zUC87XQtrLZB-0UZuWFSu_Sjv29id98xBRUQH7nsmrw/edit?usp=sharing) addresses the second, somewhat. The third, however, requires more work than any are willing to do. Once you've practiced the rules, the exercises from other shorthand books .

This collection of publications does one thing better than most other shorthand books. It shows the writing of more than one person. Callandar, while a bit messy, follows the standard rules. Stevens begins neatly, then his hand tires by the end of the longer works. He does things that, while not important enough to be rules, make similar outlines a bit more distinct, for easier reading. Clarey's writing is very loopy. Seeing this variety encourages students to experiment for themselves rather than trying to duplicate shapes exactly. If you can read it, the it's written well-enough.

I encourage all writers to share their writing, and look at their colleagues' samples. Sources include orthic.shorthand.fun , https://www.reddit.com/r/orthic/ , https://www.reddit.com/r/shorthand/ , and the Discord International Shorthand Society.

# Speeds

Before computers, most adults could write cursive at 20-40 wpm (words per minute). An introductory typing class, with 110 hours in class, required 20wpm to pass. Typical speeds are now 20-80wpm. Entry level office shorthand in the US required 60 or 80wpm. Journalists in the UK needed 100wpm until fairly recently, and often considered shorthand their most difficult course. Current office shorthand requirement in other areas is 100-120. Toastmasters recommends 120 for formal speeches. Court reporting and closed captioning require over 200wpm, usually in bursts.

Looking just at stroke count (but not actually doing the work of counting), the Fully Written level is comparable to Forkner, which is well-documented to exceed 100wpm. Orthic students have been reported to reach as high as 165 and 190wpm.

# Publications and Source Material

Most of these, and some contributions from the community, are available on (orthic.shorthand.fun) .

### Cursive, sometimes called Phonetic Cursive

A Manual of Cursive Shorthand, by Hugh L Callendar, 1889.

https://archive.org/details/manualofcursives00calliala/manualofcursives00calliala/page/n5/mode/2up

This is included for historical reasons only. It was Callendar’s first shorthand publication. Much of the book is dedicated to a systematic condemnation of Pitman. Callendar was fluent in Pitman. He was also a Victorian gentleman, lawyer, and engineer. It's a fun read.

### The Manual

A Manual of Orthographic Shorthand: The Cambridge System, by Hugh L Callendar, 1891.

https://orthic.shorthand.fun/manual

“Two and a half years’ experience in teaching Cursive has convinced me that the difficulties which beginners find in learning to spell correctly by sound are much greater than I had previously imagined; and that it is unadvisable to attempt to introduce a phonetic system of shorthand at an early stage in education.”

### The Supplement

Supplement to the Manual of Orthic Shorthand [Orthographic Cursive], Hugh L Callendar, 1982

https://orthic.shorthand.fun/supplement

“It is now nearly a year since the publication of Orthographic Cursive. The approval with which it has been greeted on all sides has more than fulfilled the author’s expectations, and repaid him for the years which he has spent in the endeavour to devise a system of shorthand sufficiently simple for general use.”
…
“The object of the following pages is to supply fuller explanation and illustration of the methods of abbreviation given in the Manual as ‘Hints for the Reporting Style’ and to provide advanced writers of the system with additional matter for exercise and reading practice.”

### Teaching (Parts 1 and 2)

The Teaching of Orthic Shorthand: A series of lessons for the use of teachers and students of Orthographic shorthand (Callendar's system), W Stevens, 1896

https://orthic.shorthand.fun/teaching-pt1

“The following lessons have been drawn up for the use of teachers in the “Orthic” system of shorthand.”
…
“If teachers and students will only follow these hints, and the lessons, as they are laid down, not hurrying, immediate success will accrue to their efforts.”

Part 1 covers the Manual in 9 lessons, and has links to practice material, and a few optional rules that are in neither the Manual nor the Supplement. Part 2 adds even more rules
Both the Manual and the Supplement ?? are needed to follow the lessons.

### Clarey

Orthographic Cursive Shorthand (Orthic) ; The Cambridge System ; by Hugh L Callendar ; Revised, Extended and Improved by E Clarey, 1911

https://orthic.shorthand.fun/  under Resources

This booklet is an update of the Manual, which merges rules from the Supplement (and Teaching??), and adds a few more.

### Notes on the Reporting Style

Notes on the Reporting Style of Orthic Shorthand, given by W. Stevens in 'The Teaching of Orthic Shorthand' (1896) , Reddit u/uwula, 2015 (2019 - 4 = 2015)

https://web.archive.org/web/20230611082516/https://old.reddit.com/r/shorthand/comments/ag2pq0/notes_on_the_reporting_style_of_orthic_shorthand/

“At the request of a couple users here, I've put together some notes on W. Stevens's The Teaching of Orthic Shorthand.”
…
“Stevens occasionally overdoes things. There is a great deal to admire here, but there are many rough edges as well, and you should expect to do some fine-tuning if you want to use Orthic in a reporting style. All rules should be taken as suggestions. I will recommend against a couple of them along the way, though you may of course disagree with me.”
