## Introduction

This document is a supplement to Cricket's Shorthand Course. It contains the full text from other books, where including the full text in the course would be distracting.

## Pratt's One Line Method

This method can be used with or without dictation, and works on several skills.

**Easy intro to dictations.** [Reddit, r/shorthand, June 10, 2025](https://www.reddit.com/r/shorthand/comments/1m1gsj5/i_thought_i_was_getting_the_hang_of_shorthand/)

> For an easy intro to dictations, you can use just one easy sentence but repeated say five times in a single sound file, to make a longer "passage", in order to remove outline recall obstacles and just get used to the dictation scenario of having to write without hesitation.

> You can do the same without a sound file, just write the same sentence down the page, and by the time you get to line 20, you feel you've gone from snail to racehorse, gets the juices going and the cobwebs gone.

Beryl's site, differences
- angle of the paper -- works if you pull the pen towards your hand for the downstroke. Experiment, so most strokes in your system are at a good angle for your writing style. Pitman's strokes mostly go up-right, right, down-right and down. Gregg's strokes do all that, but the downstroke goes slightly left, similar to downstrokes in cursive. Experiment!

- exams, corrections in the margin. I agree with Pratt that they're a very good idea in most situations, but suspect that some exams consider even margin notes to be "added after the fact." Check the rules for your exam and practice following them.

- speed before endurance. Leslie's One Minute Speed Forcing Plan has an example of starting starting with 1 minute at 60wpm, barely legible, and ending with 400 words at 80wpm. That's more than enough speed and endurance until you finish the theory.





## Leslie's Advice for the First Weeks of Dictation
{#leslie-first-week}

NINE QUESTIONS ABOUT DICTATION pag e168
1. When to introduce dictation? The first shorthand writing, and all shorthand writing done in the shorthand classroom, should be from dictation. The author’s experience has made him a strong advocate of a reading approach of approximately twenty periods. At the end of that time writing is introduced, the writing being
from the repetitive dictation of graded connected, practiced matter.

(Graded means leveled, or only using theory learned to this point. Cricket)

DICTATION AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF SHORTHAND SPEED 169
2. How to introduce dictation? Dictation should be introduced
by the use of practiced matter, without pressure for speed, accuracy,
or legibility. From the beginning all dictation should be repetitive,
but at first it is well to avoid the extreme pressure later associated
with the 1-minute, repetitive dictation plan described in this chapter.
Let the learner take his time. Do not watch his writing. Do not
check his notes. Do not require him to read back. Give the learner
time to get out of the stage of initial diffuse movements before
applying pressure; the final results will be better.
3. How long a dictation? For the first few days the dictation
may profitably be limited to 30-second readings. After a few days
two 30-second readings may be combined into a 60-second reading.
From that time on, in general, 60-second readings seem the optimum length, with an occasional 30-second reading to enable the
learner to write at a higher rate than he can get on the 60-second
readings and with an occasional reading of 2, 3, 4, or 5 minutes.


xxx The rest of the chapter covers:

4. When to introduce new matter dictation? (80-100wpm on 60 second repetitive dictation.)
5. How to introduce new matter dictation? (Gently. Easy material. Short and slow dictations. Teacher does not look at students' notes.)
6. What kind of material for new matter? (Easy! Set students up for success, not failure. Build the habit of relaxation and confidence.)
7. Where to get good speed-development material? (Answer is dated.)
8. What is the difference between dictation for speed development and dictation for mailable transcript? (Two separate skills, two separate exercises. Mailable transcript is slow enough to be legible, even slower for the first few, only one chance to get it, then type it for mailing. Speedbuilding should be beyond the learner's writing speed, to compel him to *think* the shorthand outlines faster.)
9. How much time should be given to dictation in one period? (Every possible minute!)\
    During theory learning stage, 5-15 minutes theory and the rest on dictation of material already practiced at home.\
    After theory is finished and transcription begins,\
    10 minutes—preview and dictation for mailable transcription\
    15 minutes—preview and dictation of speed development material\
    5 minutes—remedial English based on transcripts
    10 minutes—reading back and checking previous typewritten transcripts




## Leslie's One Minute Speed Forcing Plan

-- Leslie, Methods of Teaching Gregg Shorthand, page 174

xxx check format of heading/ref , and the blockquote

> To facilitate the explanation of the 1-minute plan, it is necessary to use specific speeds. The illustration begins with a speed of 60 words a minute. The figure might just as well have been 160. Assume that a class is able to write the first reading of a 1-minute dictation at about 60 words a minute. The procedure would be about as follows: 

> 1. Place on the blackboard the preview (about 10 outlines) for the first 100 words of the dictation, taking not more than 60 to 90 seconds to put the preview on the blackboard and to have a quick reading drill. These previews are read as the teacher points quickly at random; they are not written by the learner.

> 2. Dictate the first 60 words in 1 minute. Have the learners who got the dictation raise their hands after each dictation. Whenever more than one-half the learners raise their hands, the piece may be dictated about 10 to 15 words a minute faster. Allow 10 or 15 seconds for the slower writers to complete writing at the end of each dictation.

> 3. Take 10 to 15 seconds to have the learners reread the preview quickly from the blackboard. If any learner wishes additional outlines, add them to the preview at this time.

> 4. Dictate in the minute 75 words—that is, the 60 words previously dictated and an additional 15 words. Ask how many got it. Have the material read back—although not more than one dictation in ten should be read back.

> 5. Have the learners read the preview again from the blackboard in 10 to 15 seconds.

> 6. Re-dictate the material, this time 90 words in the minute.

> 7. Reread the preview in 10 to 15 seconds and re-dictate the material, this time 100 words in the minute. Not all the learners may get this fourth dictation, but urge them to keep on and write as much of it as they can get consecutively. They are not to drop a few words and then resume writing.

> 8. Re-dictate the first 75 words in 1 one minute with the instructions to the learners “This will be only 75 words a minute. It will seem very slow. Write the very best shorthand you possibly can; you will have lots of time to make good outlines.”

> 9. Repeat steps 1-8 for the next 100 words of the dictation.

> 10. Dictate at 90 words a minute the two takes just completed.

> 11. Repeat steps 1-8 for the next 100 words and again for the following 100 words.

> 12. Finally, re-dictate the entire 400 words at about 80 words a minute; the exact speed will vary with the class and with the difficulty of the matter.

> Actually the teacher will probably never dictate each of the separate takes exactly five times. All the figures given are approximations. The nature of the class and the nature of the matter and the temperament of the teacher will influence the number of the repetitions and the jumps in speed.

> Very difficult material may not be worth dictating more than the second time The best practice material for speed development is easy practice material. In the example just given the dictations were given at 60, 75, 90, 100, 75. With different dictation material or a different class or a different teacher the dictations might run 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 70. On very easy material they might run 60, 80, 100, 120, 80.

At this stage, begin each passage by writing it once, checking it carefully, making a clean copy, and copying it enough to get past the "initial diffuse movements."

t takes about six months to reach three times the speed of longhand, whatever that might be. On average. Because there will always be someone who did it in three months.

It will take considerable effort beyond that.

And this is based on regular, paced practice, twenty minutes each day.

1973

Research reports indicate that after completing one year of short- 
hand instruction in high school, less than 20 percent of the students 
are capable of taking dictation at 60 words a minute. Even more ap- 
palling, the same reports show that after completing two years of 
shorthand instruction, less than 50 percent of the students are capable 
of taking dictation at 80 words a minute. 

approximately 69 percent of the achievement in shorthand writing 
speed was directly associated with shorthand writing accuracy

pproxi- 
mately 87 percent of the student's ability to transcribe isolated 
shorthand .outlines was directly associated with shorthand accuracy.

he coefficient of determination indicated that approximately 
65 percent of the achievement (speed) in shorthand dictation was 
directly associated with the student's ability to transcribe isolated 
shorthand outlines. It should be recalled that approximately 87 per- 
cent of the student's ability to transcribe shorthand outlines was 
directly associated with shorthand accuracy.

p11 
While it has been establiShed that there is a significant positive rela- 
tionship between the shorthand student's ability to write accurately 
isolated shorthand outlines and his achievement in shorthand dictation, 
a need does exist to analyze the notes of shorthand students to de- 
termine if there is a relationship between the accuracy of shorthand 
notes recorded from connected-matter dictation and the correctness 
of the transcripts resulting from those notes

1. Of the total outlines written, 88 percent were written cor- 
rectly and 12 percent were incorrectly written. 
2. The shorthand transcription error rate, which would not in- 
clude errors in spelling, punctuation, and grammar, etc., was 
4 percent. 
3. Of the total shorthand transcription' errors committed, 50 
percent were from correctly written shorthand outlines and 
50 percent were from incorrectly written outlines. 
4. Of the total correctly written shorthand outlines, 2.3 per-

5. Of the total incorrectly written shorthand outlines, 16 per- 
cent were incorrectly transcribed. 
6. Fifty percent of the total shorthand transcription errors 
came from only 12 percent of the notes the incorrectly 
written shorthand outlines. 
7. An incorrectly written outline was 7 times as likely to be 
incorrectly transcribed as was a correctly written outline.


By 
the fifteenth week of the course, 80 words a minute was well within 
the control writing level of the class. The shorthand notes were 
transcribed twice by each student, immediately after receiving the 
dictation and again one week later. 

Non-deferred
4.45 incorrect outlines
68% of errors came from 4.45% of the notes -- the incorrectly written outlines. 
An incorrectly written outline was more than 40 times as 
likely to be incorrectly transcribed 
as was a correctly writ- 
ten outline.

1. The percent of incorrectly written shorthand outlines that 
were also transcribed incorrectly increased from 19 percent 
on nondeferred transcription to 33 percent on deferred 
transcription. 
2. The percent of correctly, written shorthand outlines that 
were transcribed incorrectly increased from 0.42 percent on 
nondeferred transcription to 0.50 percent on deferred tran- 
scription. 
3. When the transcription of dictated material was deferred 
by one week, an incorrectly written outline was more than 60 
times as likely to be incorrectly transcribed as was a correctly 
written outline.

While no shorthand authority advocates rote memorization or ver- 
balization of rules, many teachers and researchers recommend that 
greater emphasis be given the development of accurately written 
shorthand vocabulary. Teachers who believe that there is a significant 
relationship between competency in shorthand accuracy and achieve- 
ment in shorthand dictation utilize teaching methods such as vocabu- 
lary drills and word-list tests which 
are designed to build system- 
atically a shorthand vocabulary that will be written according to 
the "rules" (principles or rationale) of the shorthand system. Teachers 
who have been convinced that emphasis on shorthand accuracy is of 
no value or is detrimental to students abstain from such an approach 
and are not concerned with the accuracy of the students' construction 
of shorthand outlines.

The value of the coefficient of correlation between shorthand 
accuracy and transcription was .9305, which was significant at the

When to start dictation

20
I have observed a great 
number of classes in beginning shorthand where the teacher has 
foilowed this procedure, but where students, instead of referring to 
the textbook when they need help, actually copy outline for outline 
and do not really take the material from dictation. In some cases 
like this the students are merely 'copying pictures' rather than men- 
tally forming shorthand outlines from dictated sounds.'

If no graded new-matter dictation is given up to the time theory 
is completed, the student is sure to experience difficulty when he 
first attempts to take new ungraded dictation. This difficulty may be 
minimized by introducing graded new-matter dictation relatively early 
in the course.2i

hard to read:

There were significant positive relationships between: 
1. The ability of the student in the control group to write ac- 
curate shorthand outlines and his achievement in shorthand 
dictation (r = .5815) and the ability of the student in the ex- 
perimental group to write accurate shorthand outlines and his 
achievement in shorthand dictation (r = .6495). 
2. The ability of the student in the control group to write accurate 
shorthand outlines and his ability to transcribe the outlines 
(r = .9402) and the ability of the student in the experimental 
group to write' accurate shorthand outlines and his ability to 
transcribe the outlines (r 
3. The ability of the student in the control group to transcribe 
isolated shorthand outlines and his achievement in shorthand 
dictation (r = .6616) and the ability of the student in the ex- 
perimental group to transcribe isolated shorthand outlines and 
his achievement in shorthand dictation (r = .7144).


success in shorthand, as measured by achievement in shorthand dic- 
tation, is significantly related to one's ability to construct accurate 
shorthand outlines. As the student's mastery of shorthand vocabulary 
increases, achievement in shorthand dictation is enhanced. While it is 
true that the end result of shorthand dictation is the correct tran- 
scription of shorthand outlines, competency or lack of competency in 
29 
the writing of accurate shorthand outlines has a significant influence 
upon whether the outlines will be correctly transcribed.

Memorization or verbalization of rules is certainly not suggested; 
however, teaching methods and procedures utilized by the classroom 
teacher should be designed to encourage as great a degree of mastery 
of the shorthand system as possible. 

Word-list tests motivate students in their study of shorthand theory 
and indeed prove beneficial rather than detrimental. 
Student achievement is enhanced by expanding the amount of 
homework writing practice required. The writing of shorthand home- 
work only once is not sufficient for best results. 
Facility in reading shorthand is essential to facility in writing 
shorthand. The use of timed reading rates fosters a more intense study 
of shorthand and discourages superficial preparations

p37
No doubt 
this 
concern is due in large part to the fact that a higher percentage of 
students fail shorthand than any other subject in 
our public secondary 
schools.' Such a concern appears to be justified when 
one also con- 
siders that at the completion of 
one year of shorthand instruction, 
fewer than 20 percent of the students 
are capable of taking dictation 
at 60 words per minute;' and at the completion of 
two years of in- 
struction, fewer than 50 percent of the students 
are capable of taking 
dictation at 80 words per minute." If it is assumed 
that the majority 
of the students enrolled in the shorthand 
course are capable of learn- 
ing the skill, such shockingly low achievement levels 
must certainly 
be an indictment of the teaching procedures by which 
these students 
are instructed, for the proficiency attained by the students is directly 
related to the teaching methods utilized in the classroom.

Use either the functional or the manual method of teaching, 
whichever will give the best results, making certain adjustments 
which need to be made as indicated below. 
2. Emphasize theory throughout the shorthand program, but most 
-------- especially during the first semester. 
3. Give dictated timed word-list tests, grading not only the transcript 
but the shorthand outlines as well. 
4. Continue the emphasis upon correct outlines in advanced short- 
hand since inaccurate outlines often cause errors in transcription. 
5. 
Introduce new-matter dictation during the first semester at what- 
ever point appears desirable, so long as a limited amount of time 
is devoted to such dictation in any one period. 
6. Watch for those shorthand principles giving the class difficulty. 
Give special drills on the "o" and "oo" hooks and on the left and 
right "s." 
7. Do not require the learning of shorthand rules. This is not what 
is meant by the term "theory" today. 
8. If a dictation laboratory is available, experiment with various pro- 
cedures to see which ones will yield the best results. Do not 
expect the equipment to do the teaching. 
9. Try experimental techniques to determine reasonable transcription 
standards for shorthand students. Do not expect them to tran- 
scribe mailable copy for sustained periods at one-half to two-thirds 
their straight-copy typing rate.5 

A correctly written 
outline was as important as context in preparing a mailable transcript. 
Crewdson concluded that students should be encouraged to write 
correct outlines instead of being urged "to get something down for 
every word" in the hope that they will be able to read it back cor- 
rectly from the context. She recommended that 
more emphasis be 
placed on theory tests, especially early in the student's learning.'" 

-- so what should you do if you can't keep up???


The early introduction of new-matter dictation does not result in 
an increase nor does it retard students in the ability to take and 
transcribe new-matter dictation. 
2. 
The study provides no evidence to suggest either postponed bene- 
fits or postponed handicaps due to the early introduction of new- 
matter dictation.14 
The early introduction of unpracticed dictation material in begin- 
ning high school shorthand classes had no discernible effect on 
student achievement.' 

Ward, however, in an investigation indicating the effect of early 
new-matter dictation on the achievement of first-year shorthand 
students, found a significant positive difference in the achievement of 
students taught with the early new-matter approach.'"


Ideally, the appropriate error allowance in shorthand would be 
that which promotes maximum speed development while fostering 
an acceptable degree of accuracy in transcriptio
-- we have benefit of choosing speed for ourselves

if perfect copy tests are imposed early in the shorthand 
program, they have an extremely detrimental effect upon the students' 
skill development and tend to inhibit speed development at any level. 
It is appropriate to say that a teacher requiring 100 percent accuracy 
for passing a test should not require nearly as high dictation rates

Could a student 
trained by the perfect-copy approach who 
was capable of taking 
dictation at 80 words a minute take dictation at 120 words 
a minute 
if suddenly allowed 3 percent error? Or, could another student 
ca- 
pable of taking dictation at 120 words a minute with 3 percent 
error 
allowance transcribe with perfect accuracy if the dictation rate were 
lowered to 80 words a minute?


Research in learning theory would indicate that the student who

-- I say practice variety of speed, so you have "modes"


The recommendation that a shorthand student need possess no 
more than a 70 percent mastery of the brief forms' is not consistent 
with the fact that a higher percentage of brief forms are inaccurately 
transcribed when not correctly written than are any other words. No

Publishing Division, McGraw-Hill Book Co., Inc., 1953), p. 12.

doubt this is largely due to the fact that brief forms do not contain 
the component characters of the words they represent and are thereby 
more difficult to transcribe when not correctly written.


That is, the familiar dictation may have been previewed or unpre- 
viewed; it may have been previously used as drill in class or only 
written as a homework writing assignment; it may have been selected 
from a small number of lessons which were identified for the students, 
or it may have been selected from any lesson previously studied; and 
it may have been dictated verbatim from the text, or some of the 
words may have been altered to avoid rote memorization of the ma- 
terial. The type of familiar dictation administered, then, will have a 
significant bearing upon the level of achievement attained. 
Three-minute familiar dictation tests are usually administered be- 
tween the sixth and eighteenth weeks of instruction. If the material 
is unpreviewed, has not been practiced in class but has been written 
ftrr homework, and comes from an announced five-lesson range, all 
students should he capable of attaining the following minimum rates 
with 95 percent accuracy: Week 12, 50 words a minute; Week 15, 60 
words a minute; and Week 18, 70 words a minute. As these minimum 
standards are based on a grade of C, the scale may be raised 10 words 
for a B and 20 words for an A.


Normally, new-matter dictation, when used for testing 
51 
purposes, should have been unpreviewed and never previously admin- 
istered to the class. 
New-matter dictation tests are usually administered beginning 
with the second semester of instruction. On unpreviewed, new-Matter, 
3-minute tests requiring 95 percent accuracy, the high school student 
should be expected to attain the following minimum standards: Week 
24, 50 words a minute; Week 30, 60 words a minute; and Week 36, 
70 words a minute. 
Only the transcript is graded on the new-matter dictation tests, 
and it is customary to require a student to pass at least two tests at 
a given speed before he receives credit for passing that rate. As with 
familiar dictation, the minimum standard may be raised 10 words for 
each letter-grade level. That is, in order to receive an A, a student 
would be required to pass at least two tests at 70 words a minute 
during the fourth six weeks, 80 words a minute during the fifth six 
weeks, and 90 words a minute during the sixth six weeks.

speed building, pyramid plan vs minute plan
p54

pyramid plan -- his starts with long slow , 80wpm
The Pyramid Plan 
The pyramid plan is designed to have students writing in "speed 
spurts" at a rate 40 words a minute beyond their 3- or 5-minute 
writing rate for one-half minute durations, with the objective being 
to raise the dictation recording speed by 20 words a minute on the 
combined series of one-half minute writings. 
Assuming that the writing level of the class were 80 words a 
minute, the pyramid plan would be administered as follows: 
Cycle I 
Step 1 Preview the unusual or difficult words on the chalkboard. 
(Preview words should be written rapidly yet easily on 
the chalkboard to stress fluency of writing. Words should 
not be placed on the chalkboard before the class begins.) 
Step 2 
Dictate the entire take of 400 words at 80 words a minute, 
the current writing speed of the class. (This dictation 
interval is based upon the assumption that dictation takes 
of 5 minutes are being used for evaluation purposes. If 
3-minute takes were utilized, the introductory dictation 
need be for only 3 minutes.) 
Step 3 
Have a small portion of the dictation read back by two 
or three students. Postview the chalkboard words and 
preview additional words as needed. 
Cycle II 
Step 4 
Dictate four half-minute takes at 120 words a minute. 
Have part of the material read back. (Provide for a ten- 
to fifteen-second rest pause between half-minute dicta- 
tions. Students might request additional preview of diffi- 
cult words during this period. In drill, students should 
never write outlines without knowing the correct con- 
struction of the outline.) 

4x.5x120 = 240 of the 400 words


Step 5 
Repeat Step 4 over the same material. (The first 240 
words will now have been dictated once at 80 words a 
minute and twice at 120 words a minute.) 
54 
Step 6 
Redictate the four half-minute takes at 110 words a minute 
without pausing and have part of this dictation read back. 
Cycle III 
Step 7 Repeat Steps 4 and 5, dictating two series of four one- 
half minute takes at 120 words a minute from the last 
half of the dictation material. 
Step 8 
Redictate these four half-minute takes at 110 words a min- 
ute without pausing and have part of the take read back. 
Cycle IV 
Step 9 
Redictate the entire take at 100 words a minute without 
pausing. Have part of the material read aloud in class. 
Step nine completes the pyramid plan with the students writing 
continuous dictation at an increased rate of 20 words a minute the 
goal for which they were striving. 


The Minute Plan 
The minute plan of dictation, while somewhat simpler in design, 
is also highly effective. Assuming again that the writing level of the 
class were 80 words a minute, the minute plan would be administered 
in the following manner: 
Cycle I 
Step 1 Preview, approximately ten to twelve words from the first 
100 words of dictation material. Dictate the material at 
80 words a minute. 
Step 2 
Provide for postview and additional preview as needed. 
Redictate the material at 90 words a minute. 
Step 3 
Redictate the material at 110 words a minute. 
Step 4 -- Redictate the material at 100 words a minute. Have the 
dictation read back by individual students. 
Cycle II 
Repeat Steps 1-4 for the next 100 word's. 
Cycle III 
Dictate the first 200 words at 100 words a minute. Read back part 
of the dictation. 
Cycle IV 
Repeat Steps 1-4 for the next 100 words. 
Cycle V 
Repeat Steps 1-4 for the next 100 words. 
55 
Cycle VI 
Dictate the second 200 words at 100 words a minute. 
Cycle VII 
Dictate the entire take at 100 words a minute. Read back part of 
the dictation. (At the end of the activity, some dictation should be 
given at a control rate in order to refine the outlines and to main- 
tain legibility of writing.) 
As in the pyramid plan, the students have raised their dictation 
recording speed by 20 words a minute. 
One particularly desirable feature of the minute plan is that it is 
highly flexible and is adaptable to many variations in the drill pro - 
cedure. which is especially useful in providing for change of pace. In 
fact, an infinite. number of variations might be provided.

I should suggest:

sh from very slow dictation first for ?? starting when??



uring first-year 
shorthand, typewritten transcription can profitably be delayed until 
the last nine to twelve weeks of instruction. 
2. In second-year shorthand (transcription), continue to build 
shorthand vocabulary. Contrary to frequently expressed opinion, ex- 
tensive vocabularies do not develop "automatically" from the reading 
and writing of shorthand but rather from teaching procedures spe- 
cifically designed to build the student's shorthand vocabulary. Unless 
vocabulary drills are continually utilized, the student's ability to 
write accurate outlines will be established during the first six months 
of instruction and appreciable increases in accuracy will not occur 
during the remainder of the instructional program. It should be 
recognized that there is a significant relationship between the student's 
ability to write accurate shorthand outlines and his achievement in 
shorthand dictation. 

Dictation for transcription should be at a constant rate 
within the control writing level of the students 
approximately 20 
words below their dictation achievement. The transcription objective 
is solely to measure how many mailable letters (or other material) 
the students are able to produce from notes written within their 
control writing rate.


Do not overdo office-style dictation or the reading and tran- 
scribing from "cold notes." The majority of the dictation in the 
transcription class should be timed dictation, with occasional office- 
style dictation presented toward the terminal stages of the course. 
Although some shorthand authors have stated that with their par- 
ticular shorthand system there is no such thing as "cold notes," re- 
search does not support this opinion. However, even though short- 
hand notes do become "cold" and cannot be read 
as rapidly or as ac- 
curately on later dates as they can on the original date of the dictation, 
most of the transcription in the class should be from current dictation. 
The occasional transcription from notes written several days earlier 
does help emphasize, however, the importance of writing accurate, 
legible shorthand outlines.

Hadfield conducted a study to determine and compare the learning
achievement of students using the Gregg (DJ) symbol shorthand and two
abbreviated longhand systems--Forkner Shorthand and Stenoscript ABC
Shorthand--as measured by the dictation speed and standard vords correctly transcribed at the end of two semesters by eleventh and twelfthgrade high school students.
A total of nine public high schools were included in the study-­
three Iligh schools for each of the three shorthand systems. A language
achievement test was used to determine the student's ability level.
Hadfield concluded that the Forkner students achieved significantly
higher than the students using the Stenoscript or the Gregg systems.
The Forkner students in each ability level achieved higher than the students of corresponding levels in the Gregg and Stenoscript groups.
The Gregg and Stenoscript students achieved their highest
achievement in the 60-words-per-minute speed level while the Forkner
students achieved their highest achievement in the 80-\Vord-per-minute
speed level

A comparison of a reading approach with a reading-writing approach to the learning of shorthand
Abercrombie, William Thomas

Several factors mitigated against a successful experiment. First, a start was made with too few matched pairs, because when the groups were given their final test only 14 matched pairs could be used. Secondly, disturbing factors such as truancy, illness, and laziness interfered with some of the students' application to their studies. In a large group, these influences probably would have balanced out, but in a small group, they tended to invalidate the test results. Although the study did not prove one method of approach to the learning of shorthand to be superior to another, still it is to be hoped that further experimentation will be carried on with a view to reducing the learning time of Pitman Shorthand, so that the student will learn to use this vocational tool in the shortest possible time.

Evaluation of First-Year Shorthand Achievement. Final Report

ABSTRACT 
Pretests and dictation achievement tests were 
administered-to 1,317 first-year shorthand students and 120 
second-year students learning Century 21, Forkner, or Gregg shorthand 
in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area high schools. Forkner shorthand' 
students achieved a higher 
accuracy and transcription rate during.the 
first year of instruction. Thus, it is suggested that this is the 
preferred method of instruction for studentg who are able to devote , 
one year or less to shorthand instruction. However, by the end of the 
second year Gregg shorthand s 
bad higher accuracy scores and 
better. English error scores, suibg,that this is the preferred 
method for students who are able to tak wo years of shorthand 
instruction. None of the three shor 
nd systems included in this 
project resulted'in first-year shorthand achievement at vocational 
skill levels, assuming that maifable letters from dictation at 80 
words per minute represents inilum vocational skill.

Smith {20) summarized the following conclusions based on
his study:
(l) The Forkner Alphabet Shorthand System is easier to
learn than the Gregg Shorthand System. This conclusion
is based on the fact that when comparing systems and
achievement, Forkner achieved significantly higher than Gregg.
(2) The learning progress of first year Forkner Alphabet Shorthand students is greater than the learning progress of Gregg students.
(3) The Forkner Alphabet Shorthand System is better adapted than the Gregg Shorthand System to the above average,
average, and below average student.
(4) In one year of shorthand, Forkner excels in superiority
over the Gregg system. Three sets of dictation were
used and the findings were compared not only between
systems, but also with comparison to grade point
average of similar nature in both groups.

Note that all systems, even the simpler ones, simplify spelling and even leave out many sounded letters, which is scary at first. Trust the system. The main difference between phonetic systems often claim the write as you speak, but in fact write as the author speaks, complete with accent. Memorize the shorthand spelling of common words, like you did when learning to write English as a child. You will get plenty of practice for them. Use the spelling you think makes sense for the rest. I often use the standard English spelling for vowels, rather than think carefully about how I actually say them.
