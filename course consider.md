speedbuilding, p7, quoting Brown (Davide Wolfe Brown, from Factors of Shorthand Speed)
Fatigue As a Schoolmaster*
There seems to be particular
benefit to the young stenographer
from writing up to and past the
point of muscular fatigue. Shorthand writing long continued at a
single sitting, with no let-up when
the writer has become thoroughly
weary, appears to limber the writing machinery as nothing else will.
There are reasons why this should
be so.
Whatever people undertake to
do involving muscular exertion,
such as walking and swimming, is
at first performed with an excess
of effort. In this excess of effort,
there is needless expenditure of
mind and muscle. The surplus beyond what the act requires is wasted. Where rapidity is an object,
this waste of extort and strength
holds US back.
